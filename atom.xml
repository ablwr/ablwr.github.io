    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello. I am starting this blog specifically to talk about my upcoming dive into web development. I have been doing &ldquo;programmery stuff&rdquo; for a while (a few months, a few years, 15 years, depends on your definition) but I start at the Flatiron School in 3 weeks for their Ruby 005 Cohort and am seriously jumping in. From some intense googling, I am under the impression that we may have to keep a technical blog, so I figured I&rsquo;d go ahead and get one started now, even if it&rsquo;s not a requirement.</p>

<p>Like a good hacker newbie, I diligently checked out Octopress, which defines itself as &ldquo;a blogging framework for hackers.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s based on Jekyll, integrates easily with Github Pages, and overall seemed like the right choice for what I will be doing since it requires a little more know-how than a one-click Wordpress install.</p>

<p>And no joke! It was a workout. I&rsquo;m at novice-comfortable level with Ruby/Rails, Git, and the command line and have never used Sass/SCSS, Haml, or Markdown. But I expected to install it in twenty minutes and feel like this:</p>

<p>But ended up spending over an hour and a truly embarrassing number of commits (I just checked &mdash; 52 total!) and feeling more like this:</p>

<p>I got it working enough to do this and modify the theme a little bit, but barely. I haven&rsquo;t sorted out the problem of having to run &lsquo;bundle exec&rsquo; in front of every rake command or figured out why I have two different folders for this blog, but I&rsquo;m at least dedicated to figuring that out. And figuring out many more future problems publicly, here. I&rsquo;m a pretty private person when it comes to most things, but am forcing myself to be okay with being very publicly &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; when it comes to programming and web development. The tech field needs a lot of things, but something it really needs is the death of the &ldquo;elitist hacker&rdquo; mentality, and the rise of collaboration, empathy, and knowing that it&rsquo;s okay to not know something.</p>

<p>Still, I&rsquo;m looking forward to going from hammering out problems like this:</p>

<p>To hammering them out like this:</p>

<p>Wish me luck! Either personally or below when I get a chance to figure out how to turn comments on. It&rsquo;s gonna be a long journey.</p>
