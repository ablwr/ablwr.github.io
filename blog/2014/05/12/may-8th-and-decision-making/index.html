<div class="entry-content"><p>This post is gonna be super-cheesy. I wrote this on May 8th, which is an important day for me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m getting ready to do something kinda crazy. I&rsquo;m quitting my pretty-swell job, moving across the country, packing up my stuff, leaving many of my wonderful friends, finding extended cat-sitters for my two cats, and plopping down some serious cash. For a 3-month immersive web development course in New York. Of course, there are some obvious perks: I love New York and want to live there again, I also have wonderful friends in the city, the tech field is booming with well-paying jobs, and it&rsquo;s an interesting and creative field. This final one being the most important to me and I&rsquo;ll try to address it in another &ldquo;talking about feelings&rdquo; post.</p>

<p>Regardless, it&rsquo;s a big jump. And I can&rsquo;t help but think about another big jump that I made exactly one decade ago(!). It&rsquo;s so hard to believe that ten years have passed, but here it goes. When I was a teenager, I saved up all of the money I made working (side note: it&rsquo;s way easier to save money when you don&rsquo;t have to pay rent+utilities). I saved up all my money and put it towards a 3-month immersive Japanese language course in Tokyo. SO EXCITING, getting to learn a new language (which I later minored in), living in a new country (still my favorite place in the world), experiencing so many new things. On Saturday, May 8, 2004, me and two suitcases got on a plane to Tokyo and off I went and it&rsquo;s probably one of the best decisions I&rsquo;ve made in my life.</p>

<p>As I was making this decision about going to a coding bootcamp, all of these memories kept coming back to me. I thought a lot about how important that time in Tokyo was, how much it meant to me, and how much I learned. My Japanese isn&rsquo;t anywhere near fluent these days, but I still have an extremely strong foundation in the language that I am confident would come back if I spent a few weeks immersed back into it. I thought about all the things I learned, the people I met, everything I saw, all the hours I spent wandering around Tokyo by myself, the museums I went to, the host family I have a life-long connection with, and an endless amount of other things, big and small. Matsuri, konbini, chikatetsu, tsuyu. When I think back on how much those 3 months affected me and made me grow as a person, it became nearly impossible for me to decline to make a similar decision ten years later.</p>

<p>Because of all of this, I have been thinking a lot about the kind of person I was ten years ago and the kind of person I am now. And thinking about the kind of person that I will be in another ten years (37? Ahhhhh!). The kind of person I WANT to be in ten years, and where I want to be in ten years. I even looked back at my old LiveJournal, which was a little bit horrifying and it was hard to recognize myself, but there I am. I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about the potential path that I am currently on and the potential path if I take this leap of faith, and I only see an expanded potential for learning and growth as a person, which is just what I am looking for in life. I have a lot of feelings about this, but will curb them for now (for here).</p>

<p>So, as I post this new blog post at the start of a new adventure, cheers to May 8, cheers to giant leaps of faith, and cheers to always growing and learning.</p>
