	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name">Historical Post: Leaving My Job</h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Leaving any job is hard. Leaving a job you really love is even harder. Someone asked me when I was turning in my notice if quitting was as cathartic as it should feel, and I said I felt like I was getting a divorce. Y&#8217;know. &ldquo;I love you, but this just isn&rsquo;t working.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My job is great. However, it is also stagnant. I found myself frequently on auto-pilot, even though a lot of my work is compelling, complex, and ever-changing. I love working with newsreel outtakes from the 1910s-1940s and there&rsquo;s a constant change in material. I love working with students because there&rsquo;s always a new question about cataloging that I hadn&rsquo;t thought about. All in all, it&rsquo;s pretty good. However, it also isn&rsquo;t going anywhere and isn&rsquo;t going to lead to a more permanent position. Resources are slim, and I had to configure an eclectic, cumbersome workflow because I was not allowed to have a computer fast enough to view video files (a key component to the job).</p>

<p>In addition to feeling stagnant, there are some severe ethical concerns in any mid-tier state University&rsquo;s hiring practices, but particularly the one I have been working for, that affects my department very directly. I could complain for days about this and related issues, but it doesn&rsquo;t make for polite blogging, so I will digress.</p>

<p>I mention it because I am concerned about my field. I&rsquo;m less concerned about my specific field (moving image archiving) but very much concerned about the larger field of archives. While obsessively researching my decision to leave, I emailed a former archivist that also did a coding bootcamp, asking basically if I was unhappy in my situation because it was specific to my location, or if it was representative of the field as a whole. I tweeted something to the tune of &ldquo;I need to know that the place I work at is not representative of the field I work in.&rdquo; Unfortunately, her response as someone in the field longer than I have been is that my experience and fears of joblessness, jumping from grant-funded position to the next, and intense bureaucratic issues seemed very much in line with those of most others in the archival field, and that scares me.</p>

<p>Moving image archiving, preservation, and access to these materials are things I care about SO MUCH. However, I am faced with the reality that in order for me to have other things that I want in life (living wage, job security, job flexibility, retirement fund, adequate health care, vacations), I have to come to terms with the fact that I might have to consider doing something else, at least for a little while. At the very least, I am also very passionate about &ldquo;computery stuff&rdquo; and programming skills and the &ldquo;world wide web,&rdquo; (oh boy don&rsquo;t get me started on the free and open web), and feel that I can really make a more tangible difference in general (world) and in specific (archive&rsquo;s wacky website) if I work up some deeper programming knowledge and skills. (I could mope forever about how I wish I had done that ten years ago, but I&rsquo;ll save that rant-o-thon and put my efforts into educating young women in computer science instead).</p>
