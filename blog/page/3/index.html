		<p>This post is gonna be super-cheesy. I wrote this on May 8th, which is an important day for me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m getting ready to do something kinda crazy. I&rsquo;m quitting my pretty-swell job, moving across the country, packing up my stuff, leaving many of my wonderful friends, finding extended cat-sitters for my two cats, and plopping down some serious cash. For a 3-month immersive web development course in New York. Of course, there are some obvious perks: I love New York and want to live there again, I also have wonderful friends in the city, the tech field is booming with well-paying jobs, and it&rsquo;s an interesting and creative field. This final one being the most important to me and I&rsquo;ll try to address it in another &ldquo;talking about feelings&rdquo; post.</p>

<p>Regardless, it&rsquo;s a big jump. And I can&rsquo;t help but think about another big jump that I made exactly one decade ago(!). It&rsquo;s so hard to believe that ten years have passed, but here it goes. When I was a teenager, I saved up all of the money I made working (side note: it&rsquo;s way easier to save money when you don&rsquo;t have to pay rent+utilities). I saved up all my money and put it towards a 3-month immersive Japanese language course in Tokyo. SO EXCITING, getting to learn a new language (which I later minored in), living in a new country (still my favorite place in the world), experiencing so many new things. On Saturday, May 8, 2004, me and two suitcases got on a plane to Tokyo and off I went and it&rsquo;s probably one of the best decisions I&rsquo;ve made in my life.</p>

<p>As I was making this decision about going to a coding bootcamp, all of these memories kept coming back to me. I thought a lot about how important that time in Tokyo was, how much it meant to me, and how much I learned. My Japanese isn&rsquo;t anywhere near fluent these days, but I still have an extremely strong foundation in the language that I am confident would come back if I spent a few weeks immersed back into it. I thought about all the things I learned, the people I met, everything I saw, all the hours I spent wandering around Tokyo by myself, the museums I went to, the host family I have a life-long connection with, and an endless amount of other things, big and small. Matsuri, konbini, chikatetsu, tsuyu. When I think back on how much those 3 months affected me and made me grow as a person, it became nearly impossible for me to decline to make a similar decision ten years later.</p>

<p>Because of all of this, I have been thinking a lot about the kind of person I was ten years ago and the kind of person I am now. And thinking about the kind of person that I will be in another ten years (37? Ahhhhh!). The kind of person I WANT to be in ten years, and where I want to be in ten years. I even looked back at my old LiveJournal, which was a little bit horrifying and it was hard to recognize myself, but there I am. I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about the potential path that I am currently on and the potential path if I take this leap of faith, and I only see an expanded potential for learning and growth as a person, which is just what I am looking for in life. I have a lot of feelings about this, but will curb them for now (for here).</p>

<p>So, as I post this new blog post at the start of a new adventure, cheers to May 8, cheers to giant leaps of faith, and cheers to always growing and learning.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Hello. I am starting this blog specifically to talk about my upcoming dive into web development. I have been doing &ldquo;programmery stuff&rdquo; for a while (a few months, a few years, 15 years, depends on your definition) but I start at the Flatiron School in 3 weeks for their Ruby 005 Cohort and am seriously jumping in. From some intense googling, I am under the impression that we may have to keep a technical blog, so I figured I&rsquo;d go ahead and get one started now, even if it&rsquo;s not a requirement.</p>

<p>Like a good hacker newbie, I diligently checked out Octopress, which defines itself as &ldquo;a blogging framework for hackers.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s based on Jekyll, integrates easily with Github Pages, and overall seemed like the right choice for what I will be doing since it requires a little more know-how than a one-click Wordpress install.</p>

<p>And no joke! It was a workout. I&rsquo;m at novice-comfortable level with Ruby/Rails, Git, and the command line and have never used Sass/SCSS, Haml, or Markdown. But I expected to install it in twenty minutes and feel like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://37.media.tumblr.com/67251c0e29d86a669149105bf1abf00b/tumblr_msxaxuidVy1shab7zo1_500.gif" alt="Hacking the planet" /></p>

<p>But ended up spending over an hour and a truly embarrassing number of commits (I just checked &mdash; 52 total!) and feeling more like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--PZD0YHjX--/hgcxrafqyfevwmtsngsq.gif" alt="Hacking cough" /></p>

<p>I got it working enough to do this and modify the theme a little bit, but barely. I haven&rsquo;t sorted out the problem of having to run &lsquo;bundle exec&rsquo; in front of every rake command or figured out why I have two different folders for this blog, but I&rsquo;m at least dedicated to figuring that out. And figuring out many more future problems publicly, here. I&rsquo;m a pretty private person when it comes to most things, but am forcing myself to be okay with being very publicly &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; when it comes to programming and web development. The tech field needs a lot of things, but something it really needs is the death of the &ldquo;elitist hacker&rdquo; mentality, and the rise of collaboration, empathy, and knowing that it&rsquo;s okay to not know something.</p>

<p>Still, I&rsquo;m looking forward to going from hammering out problems like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://files.gamebanana.com/img/ico/sprays/mario_hammer.gif" alt="Mario hammer" /></p>

<p>To hammering them out like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://fireden.net/4chan/images.4chan.org//vg/src/1362844057459.gif" alt="Hammer time" /></p>

<p>Wish me luck! Either personally or below when I get a chance to figure out how to turn comments on. It&rsquo;s gonna be a long journey.</p>
