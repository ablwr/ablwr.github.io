  <div class="entry-content"><p>Everyone who has been around me regularly for the past (???) amount of time knows that I&rsquo;ve been all about learning to code as much as possible, and I&rsquo;ve been roping a few of my friends into doing the same. So, a question that I get a lot is &ldquo;Where do I begin?&rdquo; There are plenty of good guides on the internet, but I wanted to write up my own guide, particularly targeted to archivists and librarians coming out of library and information science programs. I think programming basics should be a mandatory component of ALA-accredited programs, but I&rsquo;ve found that at least in my MLIS experience (and anecdotally from many others), there is a severe lack, even in basic technical knowledge of computers.</p>

<p>Please note that I am a novice speaking to people that are even greener than me, but here are some of the web resources I recommend for figuring out if you <em>even like programming</em> and want to consider diving deeper, like I have. This is basically an extended form of an email I would otherwise be writing to my friend Marleigh.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to first talk about some more general, theoretical strategies and then go into a guide of some of the learning resources I&rsquo;ve used and recommend.</p>

<p><strong>Generally</strong></p>

<p>The following resources I am going to mention are great and learning how to program has never, ever been easier than now, with a nearly endless supply of videos, podcasts, blog posts, MOOCs, books, and Stack Overflow answers. But the most important thing to realize that if you want to learn how to code, you are gonna have to do a lot of coding and problem-solving all by yourself. The best way to learn things is to try to make them, fail, and try again. That being said, sometimes it&rsquo;s good to just get your feet wet before diving right in.</p>

<p>The second big thing is thinking about what you want to learn. If you are an absolute newbie and have never used the less-than or greater-than sign for anything other than emoticons, I recommend working on HTML/CSS first. Some people might argue that they are not technically programming languages, but it really doesn&rsquo;t matter and that is a stupid argument. After that, I recommend a few others: JavaScript, Python, and Ruby. All-in-all though, don&rsquo;t sweat too hard over which language to pick, because you are working on just learning the fundamentals, which are similar across all programming languages.</p>

<p>Ruby: I deliberated between Python and Ruby for a long time, but eventually settled on Ruby. They are both extremely popular &ldquo;first language&rdquo; choices because they are easy to use and learn, and they are very similar. If you are just trying to get a feel for what you like, it really doesn&rsquo;t matter which one you choose. My reasons for choosing Ruby are personal. 1. As a moving image archivist, I see a lot of work needing to be done with access to digital content, and a lot of that work is done in Ruby. So it is favored by my community. 2. The Ruby community strives to be very welcoming and open, and seeks to increase diversity. 3. A lot of the coding bootcamps I was looking at were Ruby-based, so that made my decision easier (as I now will be attending Flatiron School). 4. I&rsquo;m interested in web development, particularly with video on the web, and I feel like the Ruby/Rails framework suits my interests there.</p>

<p>Python: I started off learning Python, because that&rsquo;s what Codecademy teaches in its Code Year track. I loved it, I still love it, and I like how elegant it looks just based on the &ldquo;meaningful white space&rdquo; component of the language. I really think Python is probably the &ldquo;best&rdquo; first language to learn because of its &ldquo;zen&rdquo;-like methodology that pushes for code to be clean, concise, well-written, but most of all, easy to read and understand by all. If you intend to work in academia or on the science side of things, Python is a definite winner here. For general automation work in your personal life, Python is great. If you are interested in hardware hacking or think you might be, Python is also great.</p>

<p>JavaScript: If you are digging HTML/CSS and like web development stuff, JavaScript is a good language to pick. The web is sorta being taken over by JavaScript and JS libraries. If you are into design, knowing more about JavaScript will only help you in the future.</p>

<p>When learning, it&rsquo;s good to generally stay away from Rails (Ruby), Django (Python), and JQuery (Javascript) and try to focus on learning the actual language itself, not just the frameworks. The fundamentals are important. Even if things are harder, you are learning more by doing it &ldquo;the hard way.&rdquo; At least, that&rsquo;s what I tell myself. Don&rsquo;t avoid these things like the plague, I just recommend focusing on the basics of programming.</p>

<p><em>Flatiron School and Makersquare pre-work</em></p>

<p>Both of these coding bootcamps require 100-150 hours of pre-work from their students before the start of their classes. Fortunately for the rest of us, their learning materials are free and available online, so they can be used as guides for people just starting out.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-cs50x-introduction-computer-1022">CS50x</a></strong></p>

<p>I took this at-your-own-pace online MOOC based on Harvard&rsquo;s CS50 intro to computer science course when I started my graduate program, a bit over two years ago. I hands-down recommend it to anyone that wants a strong starting foundation in computer science, and I think it really sets someone&rsquo;s mind up for a better understanding of programming language syntax and structure. I pretty much just watched all of the lectures and didn&rsquo;t do the homework, but I still feel like I got a lot out of the class. If a class like this had been taught in my first semester as an undergraduate, it would have changed my life completely.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a></strong></p>

<p>In conjunction with CS50 lectures, I worked through the Code Year track on Codecademy, which doesn&rsquo;t seem to be (easily) available anymore. Anyway, Codecademy is maybe the most popular &ldquo;learn to code&rdquo; resource, and for good reasons. (One of the reasons being that it&rsquo;s free, so there&rsquo;s a very low barrier to entry). If you are absolutely brand new to programming, I recommend churning through the entire HTML/CSS track (or projects, as they seem to be now). It may be familiar, it&rsquo;s easy to understand, and even if you absolutely hate programming and never want to do it again for the rest of your life, you will at least know how to link to a website without using an enriched web editor.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a></strong></p>

<p>After hitting up a full track of resources on Codecademy, or even before, I recommend Team Treehouse. Their teaching style is through videos followed by quizzes (either questions or coding exercies), which I find to be a nice, relaxing way to learn or refresh skills when I want to still feel productive but not work too hard.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.codeschool.com">Code School</a></strong></p>

<p>Code School is great! But definitely much more challenging than Treehouse, which is why I recommend cruising through Treehouse first. Once you are feeling like a coding whiz  styling up a few websites on Treehouse, Code School is there to firmly put you back into your incredibly novice place. Code School looks easier than Treehouse, but some of the training wheels are off. Even with things I felt comfortable with, like CSS or MySQL, I would sometimes have to review the materials several times before I could solve the code exercises.</p>

<p><strong>Just Doing It</strong></p>

<p>I mentioned this earlier, but I really want to drive home this point. The above resources are great for getting your feet wet, but the only real way to really learn something is to just do it yourself, and frequently. You can do a million web exercises and read a redwood tree&rsquo;s worth of books and bootstrap up to your neck, but it&rsquo;s not gonna stick until you&rsquo;ve spent a few hours really trying to tackle a problem. The above materials are training wheels, and the sooner you take them off and try to ride/write, the better. If you get unstuckably stuck, you can always put them back on, or try a smaller/easier project. The main thing is to try, try, try. You will fail a thousand times, but keep trying.</p>

<p><strong>Other stuff</strong></p>

<p>There are so many other online resources and essential guides, <a href="http://www.openculture.com/freeonlinecourses">MOOCs</a>, but I just wanted to highlight a few. Maybe I will do a follow-up post with some other resources that I consider to be super-duper-helpful or essential to my learning. In the meantime, enjoy these and don&rsquo;t hesitate to get in touch with any questions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post is gonna be super-cheesy. I wrote this on May 8th, which is an important day for me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m getting ready to do something kinda crazy. I&rsquo;m quitting my pretty-swell job, moving across the country, packing up my stuff, leaving many of my wonderful friends, finding extended cat-sitters for my two cats, and plopping down some serious cash. For a 3-month immersive web development course in New York. Of course, there are some obvious perks: I love New York and want to live there again, I also have wonderful friends in the city, the tech field is booming with well-paying jobs, and it&rsquo;s an interesting and creative field. This final one being the most important to me and I&rsquo;ll try to address it in another &ldquo;talking about feelings&rdquo; post.</p>

<p>Regardless, it&rsquo;s a big jump. And I can&rsquo;t help but think about another big jump that I made exactly one decade ago(!). It&rsquo;s so hard to believe that ten years have passed, but here it goes. When I was a teenager, I saved up all of the money I made working (side note: it&rsquo;s way easier to save money when you don&rsquo;t have to pay rent+utilities). I saved up all my money and put it towards a 3-month immersive Japanese language course in Tokyo. SO EXCITING, getting to learn a new language (which I later minored in), living in a new country (still my favorite place in the world), experiencing so many new things. On Saturday, May 8, 2004, me and two suitcases got on a plane to Tokyo and off I went and it&rsquo;s probably one of the best decisions I&rsquo;ve made in my life.</p>

<p>As I was making this decision about going to a coding bootcamp, all of these memories kept coming back to me. I thought a lot about how important that time in Tokyo was, how much it meant to me, and how much I learned. My Japanese isn&rsquo;t anywhere near fluent these days, but I still have an extremely strong foundation in the language that I am confident would come back if I spent a few weeks immersed back into it. I thought about all the things I learned, the people I met, everything I saw, all the hours I spent wandering around Tokyo by myself, the museums I went to, the host family I have a life-long connection with, and an endless amount of other things, big and small. Matsuri, konbini, chikatetsu, tsuyu. When I think back on how much those 3 months affected me and made me grow as a person, it became nearly impossible for me to decline to make a similar decision ten years later.</p>

<p>Because of all of this, I have been thinking a lot about the kind of person I was ten years ago and the kind of person I am now. And thinking about the kind of person that I will be in another ten years (37? Ahhhhh!). The kind of person I WANT to be in ten years, and where I want to be in ten years. I even looked back at my old LiveJournal, which was a little bit horrifying and it was hard to recognize myself, but there I am. I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about the potential path that I am currently on and the potential path if I take this leap of faith, and I only see an expanded potential for learning and growth as a person, which is just what I am looking for in life. I have a lot of feelings about this, but will curb them for now (for here).</p>

<p>So, as I post this new blog post at the start of a new adventure, cheers to May 8, cheers to giant leaps of faith, and cheers to always growing and learning.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hello. I am starting this blog specifically to talk about my upcoming dive into web development. I have been doing &ldquo;programmery stuff&rdquo; for a while (a few months, a few years, 15 years, depends on your definition) but I start at the Flatiron School in 3 weeks for their Ruby 005 Cohort and am seriously jumping in. From some intense googling, I am under the impression that we may have to keep a technical blog, so I figured I&rsquo;d go ahead and get one started now, even if it&rsquo;s not a requirement.</p>

<p>Like a good hacker newbie, I diligently checked out Octopress, which defines itself as &ldquo;a blogging framework for hackers.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s based on Jekyll, integrates easily with Github Pages, and overall seemed like the right choice for what I will be doing since it requires a little more know-how than a one-click Wordpress install.</p>

<p>And no joke! It was a workout. I&rsquo;m at novice-comfortable level with Ruby/Rails, Git, and the command line and have never used Sass/SCSS, Haml, or Markdown. But I expected to install it in twenty minutes and feel like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://37.media.tumblr.com/67251c0e29d86a669149105bf1abf00b/tumblr_msxaxuidVy1shab7zo1_500.gif" alt="Hacking the planet" /></p>

<p>But ended up spending over an hour and a truly embarrassing number of commits (I just checked &mdash; 52 total!) and feeling more like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--PZD0YHjX--/hgcxrafqyfevwmtsngsq.gif" alt="Hacking cough" /></p>

<p>I got it working enough to do this and modify the theme a little bit, but barely. I haven&rsquo;t sorted out the problem of having to run &lsquo;bundle exec&rsquo; in front of every rake command or figured out why I have two different folders for this blog, but I&rsquo;m at least dedicated to figuring that out. And figuring out many more future problems publicly, here. I&rsquo;m a pretty private person when it comes to most things, but am forcing myself to be okay with being very publicly &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; when it comes to programming and web development. The tech field needs a lot of things, but something it really needs is the death of the &ldquo;elitist hacker&rdquo; mentality, and the rise of collaboration, empathy, and knowing that it&rsquo;s okay to not know something.</p>

<p>Still, I&rsquo;m looking forward to going from hammering out problems like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://files.gamebanana.com/img/ico/sprays/mario_hammer.gif" alt="Mario hammer" /></p>

<p>To hammering them out like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://fireden.net/4chan/images.4chan.org//vg/src/1362844057459.gif" alt="Hammer time" /></p>

<p>Wish me luck! Either personally or below when I get a chance to figure out how to turn comments on. It&rsquo;s gonna be a long journey.</p>
