<p>Happy new year.</p>

<ol>
<li>I have a friend who wants to learn how to code.</li>
<li>She has an app in mind that she wants to create.</li>
<li>One of my goals for the new year is to write more technical blog posts.</li>
</ol>


<p>We also live pretty far apart — I live in New York and she lives in my home state of South Carolina (at least, for now). I think one of the best ways to help her make her app is to write blog posts explaining some of the concepts that were new to me when I was learning how to code. Ruby on Rails is one of the easiest frameworks to learn for a couple of reasons: it teaches you the core concepts of programming for the web, Ruby is one of the easiest languages to learn as a beginner (if not the easiest), and Rails is robust enough to get a fully functioning application off the ground in the matter of a few weeks, even for people new to coding. And it’s just easier for me to write if I can pretend like I’m speaking to one person directly.</p>

<p>Another important note: my friend is a real Star Trek: The Next Generation nerd, so if you see an obtuse amount of TNG references and gifs on this blog in the near future&hellip; that is why.</p>

<p>Here’s the rough framework I will use to explain how to make an app while keeping it general enough for anyone (and obviously subject to change).</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><img src="/images/gityear.png" alt="git year" /></p>

<h2>0. Be a better developer.</h2>

<p>Definitely this. This was my goal in 2014 and it&rsquo;ll continue to be my #1 goal in 2015. In 2013, I had the ambiguous resolution of &ldquo;learn to code.&rdquo; Or &ldquo;learn to code more.&rdquo; In 2014, with help, I got the fundamentals down, enough to be employed full-time as a developer. 2015 is where I can continue to improve my skills and put this knowledge to good use. Which brings me to resolution 2:</p>

<h2>1. Meaningful open source contributions.</h2>

<p>Now that I am capable of contributing, I&rsquo;m ready to start doing so, even if I have to start small. I&rsquo;ve wanted to contribute to open source projects ever since the time I installed VLC Media Player (and read the documentation) when I was 14 or 15. I&rsquo;m not ready to become a C++ and algorithms master in a year, but there are plenty of open source projects that could benefit from my skill set.</p>

<h2>2. Double my git commits.</h2>

<p>I like to put something attainable and quantifiable on my list of goals. This post would have been my 1000th commit of 2014 if I&rsquo;d posted this when I started writing it (and dated: the 27th). It&rsquo;s currently at 1082. I&rsquo;d like to at least double that number by this time next year. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll have to make much of an effort here, as I&rsquo;ve been actively contributing to the code base where I work from Week 1, intend to follow through on resolution 2, above, and have too many side projects I want to get started on.</p>

<h2>3. More technical blog posts.</h2>

<p>I hate writing technical posts! I worry that they will end up dry and boring, I&rsquo;m scared of being wrong, and it&rsquo;s overall not as enjoyable as a blog post talking about my ~feelings~. But I know technical blog posts help reinforce what I know, they help other people, and they can potential help me when I inevitably forget a concept or method of server setup months down the road.</p>

<h2>4. Give back.</h2>

<p>I have been very lucky in my life, and this year in particular. So many other people haven&rsquo;t had the opportunities that have been handed to me, but I want everyone to be able to get the education and help they need if they want to learn web development. I want to keep tutoring, keep mentoring, and keep getting others excited about code. Whether it&rsquo;s helping 1-on-1, giving educational talks, writing tutorials, or even just explaining why my list starts with 0 instead of 1, I&rsquo;m ready to help out.</p>

<h2>5. Give back (field-specific).</h2>

<p>I also care a lot (too much?) about moving image archiving, digital preservation, and video on the web. Leaving my previous field was very hard and worthy of its own blog post, but I am 100% dedicated to making contributions to those fields or areas of study, even if I am not actively doing it full time.</p>

<p>Oh, and learn vim. Another easy one. My keyboard shortcut game is strong but I&rsquo;m ready to step it up.</p>

<p>2014 has been a really great year for me and I&rsquo;m looking forward to 2015.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I’m going to break this blog post up into three Cs.</p>

<h1>Cash, Confidence, Comrades.</h1>

<p>Not in that order. I’m going to rank them in order of importance/significance.</p>

<h1>Confidence</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about confidence a lot over the past several months. When I look back on my time spent at Flatiron, I felt like the program overall was an immensely valuable experience in being able to learn so much in such a short period of time, to be able to push myself to and beyond the limit, and to work with so many great people. But the biggest impact on my life is less about the knowledge I gained and more about the increase of confidence in my abilities.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize here the difference between having confidence and being overly confident. I feel like I know exactly where I am at, what I know and don&rsquo;t know, that there&rsquo;s an infinite amount of things I don&rsquo;t even know I don&rsquo;t know about yet, and what I need to improve on (which is a lot!). But beyond that, I don&rsquo;t doubt my abilities. I feel confident in my ability to tackle most things, even if I know it will probably take me longer than someone who has already done a particular task before.</p>

<p>Anyway: I don&rsquo;t think I ever would have reached that point if I had taken on learning web development on my own. I am sure that I would have been riddled with assuming I was always wrong, that I always knew nothing, and I&rsquo;d be afraid to speak up about anything related to coding because I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to trust myself when I felt right.</p>

<p>Doubting one&rsquo;s self is a massive problem in the tech field. When there are so many asshole developers out there talking down to every non-technical person, it&rsquo;s easy to start a career off with a major inferiority complex. But just like anything else, people that act like they know the most tend to not, and people that are humble are a wealth of knowledge waiting to be uncovered.</p>

<p>In this way, I&rsquo;ve overcome the &ldquo;imposter syndrome.&rdquo; Not completely, but enough.</p>

<h1>Comrades</h1>

<p>Culture fit was really important to me when I was applying to different web development programs and interviewing at Flatiron. I really wanted to work with people that were like me — Friendly people, not 100% grumpy dudes, etc. etc., not like the “standard tech field demographic.” I wasn’t going in thinking “Oh jeez I hope I am working with people that are 40 new BFFs 4 life!” Like, who goes into anything thinking that? Maybe really amazing people. Anyway, I feel like that’s what I got. Not only was the culture fit exactly what I was looking for, I also have so many great friends after the program and into the future. This is especially great for me as someone who moved to New York for the program. I had a bunch of friends living here in New York but it’s always a little scary to move somewhere and not know anyone. I did that when I lived in New York before and it kinda sucked. Now I know a bunch of great people and have a great network of people I can rely on. I’ve also met a bunch of Flatiron alumni and they are also super nice, super rad, and super amazing. Flatiron is excellent at selecting good people and turning them into developers (which is exactly what they advertise).</p>

<h1>Cash</h1>

<p>Okay, yeah. The first two are not as easily predicted as they are qualitative data, but the quantifiable data was a big concern for me. Flatiron School was not cheap, nor is living in New York, so I had to feel confident about quitting my day job and night job to go all-in on programming, something I hadn’t done for a living but had done a little bit here-and-there. At the time, the website was boasting an average of $75k annual salary for grads. I won’t go into the personal deets of others, but a recent unofficial survey of my classmates show that this data is accurate. Happy to get specific in person, but in a blog post I want to emphasize that the statistics AIN’T NO LIE. I got a Master&rsquo;s degree and took a job making less money than what I was making before. After Flatiron, my salary more than doubled AND I get crazy perks AND treated like a real person AND work with wonderful people all day AND I love writing code and figuring out problems. I have a lot of feelings about this that deserve an entire blog post. If this kind of educational track had been available to me instead of college as a 17-year-old, I would have done everything in my power to make it happen. Instead of being pushed out of computer science by stereotypes and Calculus, I could have embraced what I’ve always been good at and always have loved doing.</p>

<p>So thanks, Flatiron. I&rsquo;m proud to be a #FlatironAlum.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>A month ago, I was (lightly, &hellip;I think) called out for bailing on speaking about <a href="www.bavc.org/qctools">QCTools</a> for the Association of Moving Image Archivists conference. Nevermind the bait-and-switch last-minute-surprise-you’re-speaking scenario I had landed myself in and that I really really did want to see my pals give a talk on BitTorrent and private tracker communities as archives, I did still feel a twinge of guilt for dropping out last minute. Sorry, guys. The BitTorrent panel was pretty baller, though, and Lauren Sorensen did an excellent survey of using git from the command line earlier in the day.</p>

<p>To make up for it, I am here today on this blog to talk about how you, non-technical or kinda-technical or just-scared-of-git person, can dig in and support open source projects like QCTools, even if you don’t speak C++ (which is what I started planning for in the 2-day scramble before leaving New York on a jet plane).</p>

<p>Here it is:</p>

<p>I think a lot of people are intuitively intimidated by using git because it can be hard to understand or because they don’t know how to read code. But not being able to read code is okay because you can still make valuable contributions in English! One of the biggest sore spots for most open source software (and even proprietary software) is a lack of clear, concise documentation. But at least with OSS, if something in the documentation is confusing, instead of going on Twitter or something and being like “wah wah this free thing I downloaded totally sucks,” you can actually go in there and CHANGE it. Or at least make a request to change it.</p>

<p>I’m gonna go through how you might make those changes without having to do anything “techy.”</p>

<p>Uh, so I went to the Flatiron School which is an immersive web development program. This is how I did things on Day 1 as a shortcut to getting what I wanted (which was to deploy a user profile for myself)*. I can’t get away with that stuff now but you totally can. It’s not bad practice or anything (well, maybe the context in which I was doing it was, but that&rsquo;s neither here nor there). Actually, I did a quick edit like this today because I wanted to fix someone else’s documentation but I didn’t want to bother going through all the other steps to copy and download the repository to my local machine.</p>

<p>* One thousand blessings to Dave Rice for being extremely patient with me when I made my first changes to the QCTools documentation by submitting weird pull requests even though he had given me permission to upload directly because I didn&rsquo;t know how to push directly to the master branch.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/readme.png"></p>

<p>The main block of text on the front of a Github repository is located in the README.md file. (The .md stands for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>, a way to format writing on the web easily. (<a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">cheatsheet here</a>)) If you click on the link, it&rsquo;ll take you to a page that only loads the README. On the right side, above the beginning of the document, there is a little pencil button. That pencil allows you to go in and edit the file without having to load the repository on your computer, use the command line, or even use the Github desktop GUI.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/edit_pencil.png"></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right, click on that pencil! You&rsquo;ll open into an in-browser text editor. It&rsquo;s pretty much the same as editing a wiki. Which you&rsquo;ve totally done, right? Just make your changes right in there. At the bottom, fill out a brief, one-line description of the change you made and why you made it and add a longer description if necessary. By the way, you can use emoji in here. Use <a href="http://emoji-cheat-sheet.com">this cheat sheet</a>.</p>

<p>When you click the &ldquo;Commit changes&rdquo; button, you&rsquo;ll get a notification from Github saying that you can&rsquo;t directly contribute to the code so it has forked the repository for you and has made your changes on your branch. Does that sound confusing? Forks, branches? It just means that you aren&rsquo;t allowed to directly change the code and there&rsquo;s a process in place to make sure that only good code goes in. Everything is copied to your account and you make the changes on YOUR account. If you want the changes to go into the main product, you have to submit a pull request (just follow the steps). It&rsquo;s a pull request because you are asking the owners of the main github page to &ldquo;pull in&rdquo; changes that you made on your copy of their main codebase.</p>

<p>Got a problem? Yo, you&rsquo;ll solve it! Check out this next step while the DJ revolves it:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/diff.png"></p>

<p>The red is what I took away from the code and the green is what I added in.</p>

<p>After you submit a pull request, people can comment on it before it can get merged into the master branch. If the code change might cause a problem (or in the case of non-technical edits, if the documentation is wrong), conversations can happen here. This peer-review process helps keep open source projects strong and sturdy. Here is someone coming in to critique my simple edit soon after I opened the pull request on it for being too verbose:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/codereview.png"></p>

<p>He was right, I could make the line even simpler and not even get into the fact that the code could run in another Terminal window, so I changed my change (the screencap above was taken after that). I even changed my change after this because it still had a lingering backtick in it, as you can see in this screencap. If you change something, you don&rsquo;t have to re-open a pull request. The pull request takes the latest version of your code on your branch and assumes it is ready to move into the master if the pull request is approved. At this point, all you can do is wait and feel good about your open source contribution.</p>

<p>If you want to add to the QCTools documentation, you can follow the same steps. With QCTools, the documentation is hidden a little deeper into the codebase, but you can find it <a href="https://github.com/bavc/qctools/tree/master/Source/Resource/Help">here in the Source</a>. You have to follow the rules and the code has to validate to proper HTML, but changes are easy and possible.</p>

<p>If you are afraid to make your change, go ahead and try to change anything on any of the repositories I own. I think I even have one called <a href="https://github.com/ablwr/testing">testing</a>. You can&rsquo;t test out submitting pull requests on your own github folders because you already own them (which was disappointing when I was trying to pull together screen caps for this demo).</p>

<p>If there’s something bigger you want to fix but you don’t know how to do it, you can open an issue. This may or may not be fulfilled and it might take a while to fulfill. Obviously the best way to fix a problem is by doing it yourself. But this is a good way to provide feedback on how something like QCTools works and bring up problems that might be easy to fix by someone else. You can see that QCTools has plenty of <a href="https://github.com/bavc/qctools/issues">open issues</a> at the moment.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/issues.png"></p>

<p>The issues page is on the right-hand side of a Github repository. You can access it to see all the current issues or make your own.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/issues2.png"></p>

<p>You can see Github has a lot of issues that I added to the repository earlier today. UX needs help, people! To create a new issue, click on the New Issue tab (I didn&rsquo;t need to explain that to you, did I?)</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/issues3.png"></p>

<p>To create a good issue that people will actually pay attention to, try to make the problem specific but concise. If it&rsquo;s a bug in the program, explain exactly what you were doing to cause the error to occur and make sure to mention if you are able to make the bug repeat, or if it only happened once and not again. If you know someone is in charge of a certain aspect of a project, assign them to it. If you don&rsquo;t know, though, don&rsquo;t assign anybody and someone in charge of the project can always direct the issue to the right person or someone else can jump in to fix it. Also, don&rsquo;t follow my above example and only submit an issue if it&rsquo;s something important that will help contribute overall to the betterment of the project.</p>

<p>A final note: One thing that guides to Github or Open Source contribution usually fail to mention is that it&rsquo;s scary. It&rsquo;s SCARY, dude. It involves being assertive, telling a total stranger that you think you have a better solution to their problem, and envoking feedback from anyone in the world that cares about the project. I don&rsquo;t have much advice for this other than BE BRAVE, close your eyes, and CLICK that button (or buttons) and don&rsquo;t worry if someone wants to try to get into a fight with you on the internet. The worst thing that can happen is that you&rsquo;re wrong, and that&rsquo;s okay too. And most people are exceptionally nice and willing to work it out with you (like Dave Rice).</p>

<p>The biggest advice I can give is don&rsquo;t worry about fucking things up. It&rsquo;s git. It&rsquo;s a distributed revision control system. It&rsquo;s entire purpose for existing is to protect against things getting fucked up.</p>

<p>Extra final note: I&rsquo;m leading a skillshare on git later this month so expect more git-based tutorials or resources to come!</p>

		<p>Last week, I participated in the second <a href="http://wiki.curatecamp.org/index.php?title=Association_of_Moving_Image_Archivists_%26_Digital_Library_Federation_Hack_Day_2014">AMIA AV Hack Day</a> and paired up with NCSU libriarian/developer Jason Ronallo, CNN archivist/engineer Nicholas Zoss, and CNN archivist/engineer/manager Jay Brown. Building on Ronallo&rsquo;s <a href="http://ronallo.com/blog/a-plugin-for-mediaelement-js-for-preview-thumbnails-on-hover-over-the-time-rail/">work with WebVTT and video scrolling thumbnails</a>, we created a Ruby gem that exports thumbnail images, thumbnail sprite image, and a WebVTT metadata file with synced media fragment URLs to thumbnails within the sprite. This could allow for the integration of video thumbnail creation to happen automatically within the web access video workflow. It is also easy to install and use, making it accessible to a wider audience (always a primary goal of mine).</p>

<p>One of the things I am most proud of is how seamlessly our team was able to distribute work and pair together when necessary. I was able to jump right in as the junior developer role, helping as support and Ruby syntax consultant, as well as filling out documentation and other smaller tasks. Jason Ronallo steered the ship, but welcomed many proofreading eyes to look over his code for debugging. Nick Zoss contributed plenty of engineering knowledge and helped do &ldquo;all the math parts.&rdquo; Jay Brown went to work finding and creating sample videos for testing the scripts and worked on general QA. And at the crucial end point of the day, I wrangled Dave Rice to quickly act as ffmpeg script consultant (a cool trick I learned and helped my team win one of the awards from <a href="http://wiki.curatecamp.org/index.php?title=Association_of_Moving_Image_Archivists_%26_Digital_Library_Federation_Hack_Day_2013">the first AV Hack Day</a>).</p>

<p>Anyway, let&rsquo;s get down to it! This is how the app works. It&rsquo;s EASY! After you <code>gem install video-sprites</code>, you can run it in your terminal (assuming you have ffmpeg and ImageMagick installed and working)</p>

<p>For example, I ran this: <code>video-sprites -i /Users/ashley/Development/kiss_from_a_rose.mpg -o /Users/ashley/Development</code></p>

<p>And I got this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/rose_export.png"></p>

<p>Simple, right? And check it out&hellip;</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>00:00:00.000 --&gt; 00:00:05.000
</span><span class='line'>http://example.com/kiss_from_a_rose-sprite-00001.jpg#xywh=0,0,200,133
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>00:00:05.000 --&gt; 00:00:10.000
</span><span class='line'>http://example.com/kiss_from_a_rose-sprite-00001.jpg#xywh=200,0,200,133
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>00:00:10.000 --&gt; 00:00:15.000
</span><span class='line'>http://example.com/kiss_from_a_rose-sprite-00001.jpg#xywh=400,0,200,133</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There&rsquo;s also this WebVTT file! If I replace the example.com with the website that is hosting the image sprite (or had I specified it when I ran the gem using the -u or &mdash;url flag), I could integrate it into a scrolling video thumbnail feature!</p>

<p>Play around with it yourself! The <a href="https://github.com/jronallo/video-sprites">code is up on Github</a> and we welcome feedback. Moving forward, there&rsquo;s a lot to do to keep this gem in tip-top shape and there are many features we plan to add. Like a good junior developer, I&rsquo;ve given myself the goal of writing tests to make it a healthy and happy gem. Oh, tests&hellip;</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Last week, I was in converesation with some peers in the moving image archiving, preservation, conservation, (et al&hellip;) field and we were discussing ways to improve and empower the roles that women in the field have. One of the things that came up was it&rsquo;d be interesting to see the breakdown over time of the people presenting at the annual <a href="http://amianet.org">Association of Moving Image Archivists</a> <a href="http://www.amiaconference.com">conference</a> and whether it was appropriately stacked in terms of gender.</p>

<p>With around 200 speakers, it would be great if I could just grab this data algorithmically and not have to parse it piece-by-piece using my slow human brain! Over the weekend, I went to work combining Ruby web scraping tool, <a href="http://nokogiri.org/">Nokogiri</a>, with a library that does a pretty good job at determining probable gender based on first name (<a href="https://github.com/bmuller/sexmachine">SexMachine</a>). It was fun to wrangle data around, but not without conflicts.</p>

<p>Some problems:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I wrote a parser for the most recent conference’s webpage, but that parser can’t be used for previous conferences. The layout for the previous year is different from the current layout, and the year before that is available only as a .pdf. The years prior to that aren’t (immediately and openly) available at all!</p></li>
<li><p>The website was not marked up in a way that made it easy to pull in only the speaker names. I had to throw in a lot of remove-if exceptions because I was basically having to pull in anything that was in a p tag and removing very long strings and very short strings (and a few other things).</p></li>
<li><p>Obviously gender is a larger spectrum than the binary male-female and assessment via name is not an ideal method, but I&rsquo;m just playin&#8217; with data here! I think the results will still hold value, but I always feel a little bit icky when I also have to push things into a gender binary.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I can now take the rough breakdown of the data and just modify as needed. To do more complex problems, though, will involve more than just the parsed names in arrays separated by arrays (see below).</p>

<p>I’m not going to be able to pull out the precise data I want, but it was fun project and I was excited to spend a few hours writing (and thinking) in Ruby again, which I hadn’t really had the opportunity to do in the past month or so (it’s been all Javascript and front-end work around these parts).</p>

<p>Side note: Didn’t someone recently run a quick check on the gender breakdown of published authors in The Moving Image? That data is easier to grab because there’s less of it.</p>

<p>Plans going forward:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Run quick analysis on the organization’s membership directory to get a rough idea of the overall distribution of the field.</p></li>
<li><p>Break data down with and without consideration to one person speaking multiple times. (Which is better to consider?)</p></li>
<li><p>Break data down with consideration to time chunks and weighing one person speaking for a full block of time differently than seven people speaking in the same block of time. (Side-consideration to assess the value of poster presentation time). This involves getting down with statistics and math.</p></li>
<li><p>VISUALIZATIONS.</p></li>
</ol>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><em>Why won’t Octopress just upload my images?!?!?!?!?!?!, or how I learned to stop worrying and love the source.</em></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/glitch1.png"></p>

<p>I’ve been using Git for a while and I feel like I have a good grasp on it. I’ve also been using Octopress for a while, integrated into Github pages, and I feel like I have a good grasp on it, too. Rake tasks, right? I’ve WRITTEN rake tasks before! I got this! But for some reason, uploading images for me always seemed like it was a miracle that would work sometimes and not work at other times. Y’know… computer magic.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/glitch2.png"></p>

<p>Sometimes it would just straight up EAT my images and I’d have to remake a screen cap and get angry and keep pounding my head against the code-wall. That’s dumb, though. That’s no way to solve a problem, especially when dealing with logical beasts that perform as instructed. But I wasn’t sure what I was doing wrong. I would just keep moving things around and committing until it seemed to give up and take my images.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/glitch3.png"></p>

<p>It’s just not a good way to live.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/glitch4.png"></p>

<p>Are you having this problem, too? I decided to figure it out.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/glitch5.png"></p>

<p>I was dropping my images in the wrong file! With Octopress, there are a lot of potential places to put images. It’s tempting to put it in public/images folder. It’s also tempting to put it in the _deploy/images folder. Those are bad, though. Those are bad. You want to put it in the SOURCE folder. If you stick images in source/images, they will get picked up when running rake generate / rake deploy. If they go anywhere else, the rake task doesn’t know what to do so it just overwrites them and your images will just disappear.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/glitch6.png"></p>

<p>Maybe this is a no-brainer, but sometimes I feel like a no-brainer, myself.</p>

<h1>P.S.</h1>

<p>Another note! It&rsquo;s important to use the right syntax when adding images. One method in Markdown is to use this syntax:</p>

<p> <code>![netflixforbooks](images/markdown.png)</code></p>

<p>But for Octopress, you want to use this:</p>

<p> <img class="center" src="/images/markdown.png"></p>

<p>Otherwise, images will work on the front page of your blog but they won&rsquo;t work when you visit the individual pages. The more you know&hellip;!</p>

<ul>
<li>I had to use an image tag because otherwise Markdown automatically transforms it into regular html, aka <code>&lt;img class="center" src="/images/markdown.png"&gt;</code> So meta!</li>
</ul>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><img class="center" src="/images/oyster.png"></p>

<p>I came up with an idea to make a spoof/parody of the recently launched <a href="https://www.oysterbooks.com">Oyster</a>, a company that purports to be the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/07/technology/personaltech/aiming-to-be-the-netflix-of-books.html">“Netflix of books,”</a> allowing rentable access to digital books. This hit a sore spot among the librarians I know (and as a former librarian, I know many), because one of the biggest struggles in the field is increasing awareness in the capabilities of the modern library. Most libraries HAVE eBook access, plenty of it, and a lot of materials can be accessed through a library’s website without even having to go into the library. I think a service like Oyster has a lot of value, but I wanted to remind people that they can utilize the free resources available nearby.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/worldcat.png"></p>

<p>So, I basically just made a splash page for WorldCat. WorldCat is a collective catalog used by over 72,000 libraries. Searching a book on WorldCat, a user can add their zip code and find the closest location of that resource, so she could know exactly where to go to pick it up. If I look up Harry Potter and request the eBook format, I can see that its available at several libraries near me, one of which is the Brooklyn Public Library. Assuming the user has a library card, she can just log in and get the book onto her preferred digital book reader in very little time. WorldCat is great, but its underused (just like our local libraries). It&rsquo;s also kinda ugly, so why not make it hip to modern internet eyes?</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/netflixforbooks.png"></p>

<p>I really wanted to integrate the WorldCat API into this project, but unfortunately the API is not open and available to the public. This isn’t the time or place to ramble on about the benefits of open source and open access to databases and applications, but I would have been able to put a lot more time and effort into making a more beautiful and friendlier front-end for the face of public libraries. Alas, alas.</p>
