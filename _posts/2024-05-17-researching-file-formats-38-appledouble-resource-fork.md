This blog post is part of a series on file formats research. See [this introduction post](https://bits.ashleyblewer.com/blog/2023/08/04/researching-file-formats-library-of-congress-sustainability-of-digital-formats/) for more information.

Update: The official format definition is now online here: [AppleDouble Resource Fork](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000625.shtml). [Comments welcome](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/contact_format.shtml) directly to the Library of Congress.

AppleDouble...........................

Also known as "Dot underscore" files because that's what they look like, `._likeThis`.

Are they related to .DS_Store files? Like, in a concrete way? What about MacBinary? Those are some the questions I went through in my head while working on the FDD (now available above).

macOS makes them. I don't even want to talk about them. Can I think of something else to talk about, instead? I want my brain to be empty.
