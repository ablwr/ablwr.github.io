Hi! I haven't updated this blog since February. What gives?!

I don't want you to think I've given up on my dear friend [Marleigh](http://marleighchiles.com/). She applied to [Ada Developers Academy](http://adadevelopersacademy.org/) and was accepted, so naturally I let them take the reigns in her tech education, and we now send each other Star Trek gifs using more direct channels. 

What else?

I...

- continued involvement with [MediaConch](https://mediaarea.net/MediaConch).

- got involved with [XFR Collective](https://xfrcollective.wordpress.com).

- gave two talks at [Personal Digital Archiving 2015](http://personaldigitalarchiving.com/).

- wrote about [my experience with technology](http://www.bustle.com/articles/78360-i-found-my-way-back-to-tech-with-the-help-of-people-who-understood-why-id) for Bustle.

- gave a talk at [!!Con](http://bangbangcon.com/).

- other things that will remain a secret for now!
