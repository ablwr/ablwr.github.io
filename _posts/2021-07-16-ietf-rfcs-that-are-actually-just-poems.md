This blog post is very short, but I just had to get these out of my head!

- 21 January 1973 [PARRY Encounters the DOCTOR](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc439)
- 22 June 1973 [ARPAwocky](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc527)
- December 1985 ['Twas the Night Before Start-up'](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc968)
- September 1989 ["Act One - The Poems"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1121) 
- February 1992 [Remembrances of Things Past](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1300)
- December 1995 [The 12-Days of Technology Before Christmas](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1882)


Not poems but close:

- September 1989  [The hitchhiker's guide to the internet](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1118)
- 1 April 1994 [A VIEW FROM THE 21ST CENTURY](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1607) (There are many April Fools Day RFCs but I like this one the best)
