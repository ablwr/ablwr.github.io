Short summaries of 39c3 talks I enjoyed from this past conference:

["Coding Dissent: Art, Technology, and Tactical Media"](https://media.ccc.de/v/39c3-coding-dissent-art-technology-and-tactical-media#t=36):  Despite being at the crowded intersection of art and technology, this is the real thing. Lots of anti-surveillance work and really great example of hacking open cameras to do what you want.

["CSS Clicker Training: Making games in a styling language"](https://media.ccc.de/v/39c3-css-clicker-training-making-games-in-a-styling-language#t=401): If you ever wondered what Cohost was all about, ... it's about css crimes.

["How the FOSS Community is Combatting Software-Driven Resource and Energy Consumption"](https://media.ccc.de/v/39c3-end-of-10-how-the-foss-community-is-combatting-software-drive-resource-and-energy-consumption): oh my god we make so much toxic waste do you want to know how much do you want to know how bad this is

["1965 + 60 Years of Algorithmic Art with Computers'](https://media.ccc.de/v/39c3-1965-60-years-of-algorithmic-art-with-computers): Open convo with computer artist Frieder Nake who is an absolute fucking HOOT in like ten hundred ways.

["Who runs the www? WSIS+20 and the future of Internet governance"](https://media.ccc.de/v/39c3-who-runs-the-www-wsis20-and-the-future-of-internet): Phenommmmm talk on the history of internet governance and standards development

["How to keep Open Source open without leaving our communities open to threats"](https://media.ccc.de/v/39c3-how-to-keep-open-source-open-without-leaving-our-communities-open-to-threats): Just like it says on the tin. Oooof!

["From Silicon to Darude Sand-storm: breaking famous synthesizer DSPs"](https://media.ccc.de/v/39c3-from-silicon-to-darude-sand-storm-breaking-famous-synthesizer-dsps): I would like to spend the next 3-6 months understanding this talk about emulating synthesizers
