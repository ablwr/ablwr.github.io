When walking to and from class every day at the bottom of Manhattan, I've noticed plates of text on the ground with a date and name of a famous person. I didn't realize what these signs were about until I was walking out of the southmost Bowling Green stop and saw the initial plaque on the ground:

After that, everything clicked! They are commemorating every ticker-tape parade held on Broadway, starting with the first to commemorate the dedication of the Statue of Liberty in 1886.

Before I came to the Flatiron School, I was working as a moving image archivist. I primarily worked with collections of newsreels from the 1920s and 1930s. My job was to catalog them and put them online for access. When I realized what the text on the ground stood for, I immediately ALSO realized that I recognized so many of the names because I had seen some of the actual parades happen (on film)! The text that struck me the most while walking up the street was this one:

I've *definitely* watched this footage. I ran to the (digital) archive and sure enough, [there it was](http://mirc.sc.edu/islandora/object/usc%3A1866).

Footage identification can be difficult when you don't have a lead, but this connection was pretty easy to make. I watched the footage, paying attention to the structures of the buildings, and then pulled up Flatiron School's address on [Google Streetview](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.705328,-74.013743,3a,75y,222.42h,90.24t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sxgNehf6c2LCLopGdOjKqkQ!2e0!6m1!1e1). Boom! It was a total match!

Here is a screencap of the Amelia Earheart ticker-tape parade superimposed on top of Google streetview.

Pretty cool!

Bonus: The building that the Flatiron School is located in used to be the office building for the [White Star Line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Star_Line), which built the RMS Titanic (and many other, sturdier ships). Cool!
