I'm not trying to act like I don't care about git commit logs and streaks, because I do. In a greedy, childish way, I do and I will continue to stare deep into the soft green blocks of a Github streak. I even sit briefly-moody knowing that a job change in this year removed so many little boxes from the front half of this graph. 
 
 
Blogging your resolutions and goals is a good way to put yourself to task. [Last year](http://ablwr.github.io/blog/2014/12/27/new-years-resolutions/) I viciously wanted to do more (and I did). This year, I want to do less (but I probably won‚Äôt). 
 
But my motto for this year is ‚ÄúDo a few things well.‚Äù (It's also "no new projects" and you'll see why later.)

Last year, it made sense to be so dedicated to the hustle because I was struggling to get somewhere. At the start of this year, I am here ‚Äî I am where I want to be, and I just need to remind myself that it‚Äôs okay to take a breath if I need to before continuing climbing up the mountain. That it's okay to say no, sorry, I do not have time for that. It's okay to not submit to speak at conferences. That it's okay to spend a full Saturday doing nothing but clicking the 'next' button on Netflix if that is what I need to recover from a stressful week. I think this is something most people do without an anvil of guilt hovering above them, but I guess I am not most people.


Also, making time for friends is always, always worth it. I have felt especially grateful this year to know so many comprehensively wonderful people, so many that I can't even count.


BUT. How can I put this...

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Have a productive weekend.</p>&mdash; Shit Academics Say (@AcademicsSay) <a href="https://twitter.com/AcademicsSay/status/667847591850283009">November 20, 2015</a></blockquote>

Must my determination of success always be contingent on productivity levels, even through weekends and holidays? *I'm not even an academic!*


I don‚Äôt *really* want to (nor plan on) being less busy, but I have two problems: I care a lot and I care about a lot of things. And what I have lacked is an opportunity to focus more on fewer things and do them well. Design has been on my mind lately‚Äî- I'm not a bad designer (nor is it necessarily a truth that I am good, but I've had enough training and practice to side-eye inconsistent page-centering practices, et al), but all the design work I‚Äôve done is pretty bad because it is done as an afterthought to solving another problem and I don't give myself the time to do it well. 

For some of this year, I was working as a 'front-end developer' on a project but ended up spending the majority of my time setting up site backups, wrangling database structures, and designing the site. Labels don't matter that much to me, but at a point I became very aware that if my work was the be judged as a 'front-end designer', it wouldn't make me feel very good considering only 1/6th of my time (of which was already limited -- as nonprofit budgets are, no shame there) had been dedicated to that component. So by the time I got around to writing HTML/CSS/JS, you bet I popped Bootstrap on it and you might even find some !importants strewn throughout a hastily-gathered base CSS template (sorry my front-end pals if you've since left screaming -- the site is not done, I will make the !important un-important in due time, but sorry about the decidedly un-hip Bootstrap). When this site goes live or the code is made open, will I seem bad or lazy? I *like* to think that I am neither, but the constraint of time would perceive me as such. This also goes along with me *liking to think* that I have a "strong attention to detail." Doesn't everybody like to think that about themselves? But when there are a million details instead of a thousand details, it's harder to give them all attention.

I'm not close to burning out (maybe because I just basically spent the last two days Straight Chillin'), but recognizing burnout as a thing and taking preventative measures is important in this upcoming year. A problem for me is that I *like* doing it all but there is so much value in focusing on less in order to produce better results. 

For context, here‚Äôs an abbreviated list of things I will fret over in 2016: [New York Public Library](https://nypl.org) (in many ways, in many applications, and most important of all), [MediaConch](https://mediaarea.net/MediaConch/), [XFR Collective](https://xfrcollective.wordpress.com/), [QC Tools](https://github.com/bavc/qctools), [ffmprovisr](http://amiaopensource.github.io/ffmprovisr/), [Screen Slate](http://www.screenslate.com/), [La MaMa](http://lamama.org/), Actual Material, Code4lib‚Äôs video stream, AMIA committees, W*iHPEM formations‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more than one of that-other-thing-I‚Äôve-already-forgotten-about and that-thing-I-don‚Äôt-yet-know-about. There are also other, small, secret things that are just for me and I am sad they are not given the care and attention I wish I had for them. When I see an amazing side project or personal portfolio site, my eyes always flash green for a second, envious of time. I also tend to add things to that pile -- the personal-projects-pile -- because it is so much easier and more fun to think of something I'd like to do rather than actually spend time doing it. So a side-goal is to not start anything new until I've finished what has been started.

But... right? That's a lot of stuff. Keep me in check. Keep me in ample quantities of chocolate-covered espresso beans. 2016 is going to be great but only if we take care of ourselves and of each other.
