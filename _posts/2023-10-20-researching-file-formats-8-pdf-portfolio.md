This blog post is part of a series on file formats research. See [this introduction post](https://bits.ashleyblewer.com/blog/2023/08/04/researching-file-formats-library-of-congress-sustainability-of-digital-formats/) for more information.

PDF Portfolio files! PDF is already such a tangled spaghetti mess of a format, and this format is just taking a whole bunch of them and making them into a mega-pasta dish.

Here's an [overview](https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/overview-pdf-portfolios.html)

And Flash is required to make these files! Or at least some of the time!

I won't be attempting it but seems like it could be fun to try?

Just some statements I find terror-inducing:

"There are 2 different file formats for adobe portfolios. The old format used Adobe Flash technology. The new format doesnâ€™t use this technology." ([ref](https://www.dot.nd.gov/manuals/design/caddmanual/UG_Meetings/Adobe_Portfolio_Guide_DC1.pdf))

"You can convert multimedia files, such as MP3 to PDF within a PDF Portfolio. You can also convert these files to PDF if they are encoded in H.264 (with AAC audio): MOV, M4V, MP4, 3GP, and 3G2." ([ref](https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/create-customize-pdf-portfolios.html))

"Always saves as a PDF Portfolio do not want this " ([ref](https://acrobat.uservoice.com/forums/590923-acrobat-for-windows-and-mac/suggestions/33719989-always-saves-as-a-pdf-portfolio-do-not-want-this))

If you were me, would you consider a PDF Portfolio to be unitary or a container-wrapper format (based on the [GDFR classification guidelines here](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/intro/GDFR-Classification-1_0_5.pdf))? I'm going with existing practice to keep things consistent, but it's a complicated question for a complicated format.
