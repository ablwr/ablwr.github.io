Hello! Today is the day! 

**The Illustrated Guide to Audio Formats** and **The Illustrated Guide to Film Formats** are now available (or can become available) everywhere books are sold!

[Buy 'em now!](https://mediaguides.archivesoftomorrow.com/books/)

You can also visit my [Author page on Bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org/contributors/ashley-blewer) or my [Author page on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Ashley-Blewer/author/B0B6CW37SQ).

These books are arriving [one year after](https://bits.ashleyblewer.com/blog/2022/08/06/the-illustrated-guide-to-video-formats-now-available/) the first of the series, The Illustrated Guide to Video Formats, was published. It's been a huge amount of work researching formats, selecting and narrowing down to 36 formats, building websites, drafting illustrations, refining details, working with fact-checkers, assembling, proofing, re-proofing, finalizing, re-finalizing, final_final_finalFINALversion-checking, and publishing.

Please consider picking up a copy or sharing widely with your friends. Especially with the recent stratification of social media, it's harder to get the word out!

As a reminder, the Media Guides have a dedicated website where you can grab or share the illustrations and data anytime: https://mediaguides.archivesoftomorrow.com/

I want to thank my reviewers: Susie Cummings and Andrew Weaver (Audio), C. Diaz and David Neary (Film).

In other great news, all three books have been *translated into Spanish*! The translation work is complete (link available [on the Media Guides website](https://mediaguides.archivesoftomorrow.com/data/)), and I'll be working through updating the page layouts and doing other steps required to publish. The translation was done by [Valeria DÃ¡vila](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valeriadavila), and she was absolutely a joy to work with -- very thorough and exactly perfect, every time! I am aiming to publish these by November.

I wrote [a little bit about this](https://bits.ashleyblewer.com/blog/2022/05/09/accidentally-making-a-book-video-format-illustrations/), but as much of my creation process was open source, unless it was not possible (for example, uploading to publishing platforms and digital proof review -- its out of my hands at that point). See that linked post for more details.
