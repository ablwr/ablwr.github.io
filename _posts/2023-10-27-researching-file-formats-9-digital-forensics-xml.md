This blog post is part of a series on file formats research. See [this introduction post](https://bits.ashleyblewer.com/blog/2023/08/04/researching-file-formats-library-of-congress-sustainability-of-digital-formats/) for more information.

Update: The official format definition is now online here: [Digital Forensics XML](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000611.shtml). [Comments welcome](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/contact_format.shtml) directly to the Library of Congress.

Digital Forensics XML, XML for your digital forensics.

This had me thinking about [BitCurator](https://bitcurator.net/), which is a toolkit that had several years of public funding, and some institutional tie-in, but now has a community group and I wasn't sure about what the sustainability model for the project was? There's a [consortium](https://bitcuratorconsortium.org/), but is the membership model sustainable?

So while working on this format, I spent a lot of time thinking about the fragility of grant-funded projects that don't have a clear path to financial sustainability, to the intense instability of links (y'know, linkrot) and general web maintenance concerns. I don't want to imply that any of the (often always wonderful) people working on these efforts are to blame; it's just a massive amount of work that doesn't receive a lot of attention or acknowledgement, and it's often a very slow build-up over time. Hardly the first person to have these thoughts, just what's been on my mind as I receive bounce-back emails or hit broken URLs with no direct replacement or backup copy.

I'm a bit worried about [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1aiVUMP18H3eg5cUu-3y7fiKxdvVc4Jf7YIKRh5s5ZEQ/pub?output=html), because gdocs are really sensitive to being randomly deleted from someone who doesn't realize its useful and then disappear from the web. (It wasn't on wayback until I manually chose for it to be captured)

([Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aiVUMP18H3eg5cUu-3y7fiKxdvVc4Jf7YIKRh5s5ZEQ/edit#gid=0)is a version that you can copy and save to your own gdrive, if you're interested.)

I also don't know the date on this doc, or if it's still useful/applicable. This was true for a lot of the content produced in-the-moment about DFXML or BitCurator.

There was also a good amount of information on the Forensics Wiki, which seems to have ~~gone under~~ ...gone under... [a renovation](https://osdfir.blogspot.com/2022/11/transitioning-forensics-wiki-to-github.html), with the [new site here](https://forensics.wiki/). There's still a good bit from [what's captured](https://forensicswiki.org/wiki/Main_Page) that is available (which is probably a lot). This only fueled my muddled thoughts around what disappears not through a death but just through not being able to be found.

Final unrelated thought: This talk from Alex Nelson, "[Enumerating and Analyzing Storage Data with DFXML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bXmiy5yfO4)", from 2015 is both educational and entertaining.
