In June, I started working on a project that will run for the next year -- it's helping the Library of Congress update their [Sustainability of Digital Formats](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/) page with around 40 new file formats! You can see the [list of 2023-2024 formats here](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd_workplan.shtml) -- those are the formats I'll be researching.

There's an announcement in this [general updates post](https://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/2023/06/filling-in-the-file-format-gaps/) from the Library of Congress and [another announcement blog](https://myriadconsultants.org/blog/enhancing-file-format-documentation-myriads-commitment-to-collaboration-transparency-and-efficiency) from Myriad.

Doing this research is a huge thrill for me!! Most of my time is going straight into the formats research, with a little time spent answering clarifying questions from my teammates and also doing the XML conversion required for the project. Since I'm spending a lot of time with each format, I thought it'd be nice to document some of the things I'm learning along the way that are ... well, things that just don't fit into a standard open government document, like my opinions and weird discoveries. So I'm going to do that here on my blog!

**This blog series represents my views and my views only, and they do not reflect the views of any of my colleagues, and definitely not the views of any companies/organizations, because they don't have feelings anyway.**

(I started drafting the first several posts and some of them have at least started off a little fiery so it seems appropriate to say that in advance.)

I realize there's a chance you're coming across this Sustainability of Digital Formats page for the first time via this blog post. Well, it's a great and continually updated resource -- don't let the vintage web design fool you! I like to [review the entire list](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/browse_list.shtml). I like this resource not just as a way to understand the assessed state of preservation risks for individual formats, but just in general to learn about the way a format works and the format history. There's also relationships with other formats, which is essential for anyone just learning that a "format" like a video file can actually be at least three formats rolled up into one (the container, the audio codec, the video codec).

This blog post will (eventually) serve as a canonical list of all of the entries in order (and you can always visit the [tags section of my blog](https://bits.ashleyblewer.com/tags/)).

We are not working in set order, so the posts won't correspond to the [published list](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd_workplan.shtml). This projects is running from June 2023 until May 2024. I am aiming to post roughly once a week.

Here's a tip for following along: Click the little satellite on this blog's sidebar if you would like [an RSS feed](https://bits.ashleyblewer.com/feed.xml)(or click that link right there) and want to stay up to date that way! Otherwise, I will be posting weekly notifications [on Mastodon](https://digipres.club/@ashley).
