<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to act like I don&rsquo;t care about git commit logs and streaks, because I do. In a greedy, childish way, I do and I will continue to stare deep into the soft green blocks of a Github streak. I even sit briefly-moody knowing that a job change in this year removed so many little boxes from the front half of this graph.</p>

<p>Blogging your resolutions and goals is a good way to put yourself to task. <a href="http://ablwr.github.io/blog/2014/12/27/new-years-resolutions/">Last year</a> I viciously wanted to do more (and I did). This year, I want to do less (but I probably won‚Äôt).</p>

<p>But my motto for this year is ‚ÄúDo a few things well.‚Äù (It&rsquo;s also &ldquo;no new projects&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll see why later.)</p>

<p>&hellip;?</p>

<p>Last year, it made sense to be so dedicated to the hustle because I was struggling to get somewhere. At the start of this year, I am here ‚Äî I am where I want to be, and I just need to remind myself that it‚Äôs okay to take a breath if I need to before continuing climbing up the mountain. That it&rsquo;s okay to say no, sorry, I do not have time for that. It&rsquo;s okay to not submit to speak at conferences. That it&rsquo;s okay to spend a full Saturday doing nothing but clicking the &lsquo;next&rsquo; button on Netflix if that is what I need to recover from a stressful week. I think this is something most people do without an anvil of guilt hovering above them, but I guess I am not most people.</p>

<p>Also, making time for friends is always, always worth it. I have felt especially grateful this year to know so many comprehensively wonderful people, so many that I can&rsquo;t even count.</p>

<p>BUT. How can I put this&hellip;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Have a productive weekend.</p>&mdash; Shit Academics Say (@AcademicsSay) <a href="https://twitter.com/AcademicsSay/status/667847591850283009">November 20, 2015</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>Must my determination of success always be contingent on productivity levels, even through weekends and holidays? <em>I&rsquo;m not even an academic!</em></p>

<p>I don‚Äôt <em>really</em> want to (nor plan on) being less busy, but I have two problems: I care a lot and I care about a lot of things. And what I have lacked is an opportunity to focus more on fewer things and do them well. Design has been on my mind lately‚Äî- I&rsquo;m not a bad designer (nor is it necessarily a truth that I am good, but I&rsquo;ve had enough training and practice to side-eye inconsistent page-centering practices, et al), but all the design work I‚Äôve done is pretty bad because it is done as an afterthought to solving another problem and I don&rsquo;t give myself the time to do it well.</p>

<p>For some of this year, I was working as a &lsquo;front-end developer&rsquo; on a project but ended up spending the majority of my time setting up site backups, wrangling database structures, and designing the site. Labels don&rsquo;t matter that much to me, but at a point I became very aware that if my work was the be judged as a &lsquo;front-end designer&rsquo;, it wouldn&rsquo;t make me feel very good considering only 1/6th of my time (of which was already limited &mdash; as nonprofit budgets are, no shame there) had been dedicated to that component. So by the time I got around to writing HTML/CSS/JS, you bet I popped Bootstrap on it and you might even find some !importants strewn throughout a hastily-gathered base CSS template (sorry my front-end pals if you&rsquo;ve since left screaming &mdash; the site is not done, I will make the !important un-important in due time, but sorry about the decidedly un-hip Bootstrap). When this site goes live or the code is made open, will I seem bad or lazy? I <em>like</em> to think that I am neither, but the constraint of time would perceive me as such. This also goes along with me <em>liking to think</em> that I have a &ldquo;strong attention to detail.&rdquo; Doesn&rsquo;t everybody like to think that about themselves? But when there are a million details instead of a thousand details, it&rsquo;s harder to give them all attention.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not close to burning out (maybe because I just basically spent the last two days Straight Chillin&#8217;), but recognizing burnout as a thing and taking preventative measures is important in this upcoming year. A problem for me is that I <em>like</em> doing it all but there is so much value in focusing on less in order to produce better results.</p>

<p>For context, here‚Äôs an abbreviated list of things I will fret over in 2016: <a href="https://nypl.org">New York Public Library</a> (in many ways, in many applications, and most important of all), <a href="https://mediaarea.net/MediaConch/">MediaConch</a>, <a href="https://xfrcollective.wordpress.com/">XFR Collective</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bavc/qctools">QC Tools</a>, <a href="http://amiaopensource.github.io/ffmprovisr/">ffmprovisr</a>, <a href="http://www.screenslate.com/">Screen Slate</a>, <a href="http://lamama.org/">La MaMa</a>, Code4lib‚Äôs video stream, W*iHPEM formations‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more than one of that-other-thing-I‚Äôve-already-forgotten-about and that-thing-I-don‚Äôt-yet-know-about. There are also other, small, secret things that are just for me and I am sad they are not given the care and attention I wish I had for them. When I see an amazing side project or personal portfolio site, my eyes always flash green for a second, envious of time. I also tend to add things to that pile &mdash; the personal-projects-pile &mdash; because it is so much easier and more fun to think of something I&rsquo;d like to do rather than actually spend time doing it. So a side-goal is to not start anything new until I&rsquo;ve finished what has been started.</p>

<p>But&hellip; right? That&rsquo;s a lot of stuff. Keep me in check. Keep me in ample quantities of chocolate-covered espresso beans. 2016 is going to be great but only if we take care of ourselves and of each other.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>For this year&rsquo;s hackday, I brought <a href="https://amiaopensource.github.io/ffmprovisr">ffmprovisr</a> to the table. This was an app I made over a year ago that hadn&rsquo;t been given enough attention, primarily due to lack of time. My <a href="http://wiki.curatecamp.org/index.php/Association_of_Moving_Image_Archivists_%26_Digital_Library_Federation_Hack_Day_2015#ffmprovsr">fumbling pitch</a> went something like this: &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;d be fun to combine and continue to build up these two projects into something better because ffmpeg continues to live on as a mysterious but necessary component of a/v archival practice. This project would be mostly R&amp;D with some basic front-end web development skills (building forms). I feel this is a little out of the scope of hack day (and those greedy for rewards may seek refuge elsewhere) in that it&rsquo;s more of a REMIX project and a mostly-hack-the-docs-with-some-coding project, but if there is interest (there was last year, for ffmprovisr) &mdash; we will build the hell outta this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I envisioned building on the old version of ffmprovisr, which was a guided form for building ffmpeg scripts, but on hack day I realized it was a little too heavy on the hand-holding &mdash; archivists that at least had ffmpeg installed on their computers didn&rsquo;t need to click through forms and select their input and output. They could reasonably be expected to have the ability to look at a sample script and base their own script off of it. So we changed the structure from a form to a sample command line that also came with a description of what it did and a breakdown of how each command worked.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/thinkingffmprovisr.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>When originally pitching this idea, I thought it&rsquo;d be a good &ldquo;gateway drug&rdquo; to capture archivists and turn them into developers, anticipating a lot of git knowledge sharing and code-writing habits. In the end, I was primarily the one pushing code (but also Rebecca Fraimow) while everyone else helped to add interesting sample scripts to our shared google doc, parsing commands pulled from the ffmpeg documentation from previous hackdays or dropping in scripts they use regularly as archivists. So the project ended up being even stronger than I imagined it would be (and helped provide the biggest lack from the existing proof-of-concept application)!</p>

<p>So the best part about hackday was the collabartive elements. It was great seeing collaboration happen live between <a href="https://bavc.org/">BAVC employees</a> and <a href="http://reto.ch/">Reto Kromer</a>, as well as get some in-use scripts from Catriona Schlosser from <a href="http://www.cuny.tv/">CUNY-TV</a> and Nicole Martin from <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>. While Eddy Colloton (MIAP) was working on a script that converts a DCP into access copies, help came in on our shared google doc from Kieren O&#8217;Leary (<a href="http://www.ifi.ie/archive">Irish Film Archive</a>), participating remotely from Ireland.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/ffmprovisrtransfer.png" width="500"></p>

<p>We had been working on a forked branch of my original repo, but when I came home from AMIA, I did the right thing and gave ffmprovisr to the people &mdash; it now has a permanent home in the <a href="https://github.com/amiaopensource/ffmprovisr">amiaopensource repo</a> where collaboration has continued to thrive, mostly thanks to the strong support from Reto, who diligently modified the code to make it consistent and easier to read. Thanks, Reto!</p>

<p>P.S. super happy I went 2009-trendy-internet-tumblr-style with the name of this app because I saw tweets go out as ffmprovisor, ffmproviser, and ffmprovisr (and maybe a few other variations in between).</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I&rsquo;ve been kinda bad at blogging. I have a new job and some old jobs and lots of things that keep me from introspecting on code and archives. Fortunately I have great friends, and one of those friends is Kathryn Gronsbell, who reached out to me as an emerging developer (whether she thinks so or not) and wanted to write a <em>guest blog post</em>! As for me, a person who has very recently had to take on the codebase of at least five web complex and non-similar applications at my job&hellip; I can appreciate some good commenting. Commented-OUT code, on the other hand&hellip;</p>

<h1>Show Your Work: Why I know commenting your code is bad, but I do it anyway.</h1>

<h3>Kathryn Gronsbell</h3>

<h3>2015-11-05</h3>

<p>I like to ship ugly, early, and often. My challenge is I‚Äôm a Kathryn* who is in the middle of doing three very critical things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Learning enough Python and Bash to be functional (and dangerous)</li>
<li>Building small scripts to expedite digitized asset quality control at my organization</li>
<li>Trying to triangulate how and why certain decisions were made and performed before my arrival, and how to understand, fix/reverse, or move forward (see Steps 1 and 2)</li>
</ol>


<p>In 2013, Peter Vogel explained why ‚Äúpeople‚Äù should not document or comment their code <a href="https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2013/07/26/why-commenting-code-is-still-bad.aspx">[1]</a>. Vogel makes well-executed arguments, steeped both in conceptual logic and pragmatism.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSome readers suggested that comments provided insight into what previous programmers thought their code was doing. I don&rsquo;t care what those programmers thought their code was doing &mdash; I only care what their code actually does (though I do care why the previous programmers thought the code was necessary).‚Äù</p>

<p>I agree with Vogel here, on all points. But, I do care what the previous person thought their code was doing because it can help explain OTHER decisions that are not documented in the code (or anywhere else). And because my code is wobbly, like a baby deer that snuck into a moonshine distillery, I feel the need to add comments and leave some less elegant code commented-out so I can understand how a certain chunk came together.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="c">#This loops through the files and sets a variable ‚Äúbambi‚Äù for the extracted string. This takes the legacy strings which are all uppercase and makes them lowercase alphanumeric strings so that they validate against the strings we create locally.</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">key</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">forest_fileDict</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="n">bambi</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">forest_fileDict</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="p">)]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">lower</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="c"># bambi = bambi.lower()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It works, for me and for now. When it doesn‚Äôt work anymore I won‚Äôt do it anymore. Vogel‚Äôs argument about resource-intensity of code commenting reads true, but it also doesn‚Äôt apply to my current situation. Describing what the code does helps me learn (because I wrote it and had someone else verify it was accurate). I yearn for the day I can write something that is both self-describing and that I can read in 3 weeks and understand. Until then, I will crawl along with my #-prefaced nuggets of wisdom &ndash; and happily share my MacGyver‚Äôed efforts for review and revision.</p>

<p>If I listened to this ideal practice, I wouldn‚Äôt be creating the processes I need to do my job because it would be too big of an obstacle to take on for every little process I needed done. The code will be ugly, but it will work. And that‚Äôs what we should aim for &ndash; an agile approach to learning and making. Imperfect action is better than perfect inaction.</p>

<p>I hope if you‚Äôre in a similar spot, you now know that you have a comrade. And that one day you, too, can be a ‚Äúpeople‚Äù Vogel is talking to.</p>

<p>* Being a Kathryn does not involve being a real programmer or code guru. Being a Kathryn means spending hours on StackOverflow, sending over-explanatory email pleas to our very patient IT support folks, and constantly chatting friends about why my nested dictionaries aren‚Äôt printing as expected. And thanking very smart co-workers for helping crack uncrackable nuts.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Note: I wrote this up and added it to the !!Con <a href="https://github.com/hausdorff/bangbangcon.github.io/tree/gh-pages/2014-transcripts">github README</a> but CC&#8217;ing it here for ~outreach~ purposes!</p>

<p><a href="http://bangbangcon.com">!!Con</a> had a live stenographer for live closed captioning of all talks, and follow-up transcripts of all talks. AMAZING! The only conference I‚Äôve seen rivaling this level of inclusivity was Virginia Tech‚Äôs <a href="http://www.cpe.vt.edu/gbt/">Gender, Bodies, and Technology conference</a> which offered live signing for all sessions not segmented into tracks. Also amazing.</p>

<p>2014 !!Con‚Äôs talks are all <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2kxl-dcUYQQvTCuQtfuChQ">up on YouTube</a>, which is great. But all of us, together, can collaborate to take these talks to the next level by syncing up those <em>great</em> transcripts with these <em>great</em> videos!</p>

<p>I know what you might be thinking: Doesn&rsquo;t YouTube offer <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3038280?hl=en">auto-captioning</a>? The answer is YES, it does. And it‚Äôs pretty great for some things, but not so great for live talks in terms of reliability.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/bad_captions.png" title="" ></p>

<p>Introducing <a href="https://amara.org">Amara</a>. I‚Äôve read about Amara but had never used it before today, and it is RAD. It makes subtitling SO easy, utilizing hotkeys and hitting all of the pain points that come with transcription (which I‚Äôve done a lot of ‚Äî not super easy).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/amara.png" title="" ></p>

<p>So here is how to link the !!Con transcript to the shared video.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm sure there is a better way to do this, but I prepped the available transcription text file in SublimeText by adding a line break in between each existing line by holding down Control-Shift-DownArrow until it got the bottom, and then I pressed enter. You can do whatever works for you, but the text won&rsquo;t import correctly as-is so this minor data-wrangling is necessary.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/transcript.png" title="" ></p>

<p>This way, when I went to upload the subtitles, they were already broken down into bite-size pieces. Some cleanup might be necessary after this point, like getting rid of blank subtitles.</p>

<p>You may be tempted to move ahead and tell Amara are finished so you can check to see if your work is working right. Just know that Amara doesn‚Äôt like it when you do this. It will assume you are done ingesting subtitles and will think you are ready for the timing zone. I spent a while fussing around in this area. The subtitles will save, though, so you can leave and come back as long as you save a draft.</p>

<p>Next is the fun part ‚Äî Watching the video and getting the subtitles in sync. First, it‚Äôs fun because you get to watch the talk! Second, it‚Äôs fun because you press the ‚Äúdown‚Äù button to move to a new subtitle and you get in a rhythm that is both videogame-esque and meditation-esque. I like it. If you lose your groove, you can tab to pause the video or you can go back and use the slider to adjust the timing on subtitles on an individual basis.</p>

<p>After that, you can save/publish and you are done. The !!Con organizers are able to take it from there because the !!Con YouTube account is already ready to receive the Amara subtitles, which get synced on a regular basis. That&rsquo;s it!</p>

<p>This is a GREAT way to feel super-productive even if you are feeling too under-the-weather to do other work. (Now that I‚Äôm all-freelance all-the-time, I‚Äôm super obsessed about whether I am at an optimal state to be billing hourly for my brain.)</p>

<p>Hmmmm&hellip; But wait &mdash; I did the video you see in examples above. But how do you know if the video you are gonna transcribe has already been done or not? What a great question. You can comment on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MNZH-58vBXpVjzYHObV6vs1NSAK5QQ8v-g4wBEVdZqY/edit?usp=sharing">this Google Spreadsheet</a> and then everyone will know what is going on!</p>

<p>In closing&hellip; Don‚Äôt stop there! Plenty of conferences and other things could use help with reliable closed captioning!</p>

<p>Okay! Last time we talked about the magic of <code>rails generate</code> and the structure that gets created when you make a new Rails project. I gave you a soft warning to pay close attention to the app/ folder with the foreboding &ldquo;Just remember the MVC&rdquo;&hellip; Now let&rsquo;s talk about the MVC.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not the only person to use this analogy, but here it goes and I know you&rsquo;ll be able to relate to it. The best way I&rsquo;ve found to understand MVC is to treat the framework like a restaurant.</p>

<p>The restaurant is broken up into three parts: Chefs working behind the scenes to make a great meal, servers that deliver the meal to the customers so they can eat it, and plates/tables/utensils so the meal can be enjoyed. Your app is THE MEAL!</p>

<p><strong>Models</strong> &mdash; <strong>Chefs</strong></p>

<p>Models hold the code. They hold the logic. They are the brains of the operation. A master chef has to take all of the individual pieces of something and put them together just right to make something delicious.</p>

<p><strong>Controllers</strong> &mdash; <strong>Servers</strong></p>

<p>The chef is too busy making a masterpiece to give her customers the meal herself! She&rsquo;s got work to do! The controllers help keep all the beautiful, well-crafted meals going out to the right customers. Being a server (the restaurant kind) is hard work, keeping track of what everyone ordered and where they are seated. The controller takes data from the model and delivers it to the plate.</p>

<p><strong>Views</strong> &mdash; <strong>Plates</strong></p>

<p>Yum yum, time to eat these snacks up, right? The view is where all the front-end work comes into play. It&rsquo;s a very important component because just because you have a delicious meal, no one is gonna come to your restaurant if its lookin&#8217; like the Wing Basket. Or maybe they will and it&rsquo;ll be the best kept secret in town. Anyway, the view is dedicated to make all your hard work and code look great so people will actually want to consume it.</p>

<p>MVC is a good framework to know, but what&rsquo;s the point? The point is to keep your code clean. Coding means juggling a lot of different things at once, so this framework helps you figure out where you need to go to find your problem and fix it. Is your math not working? Check your models. Is the math being delivered to the wrong page? Check your controllers. Is the math problem just super ugly? Take a look at your views.</p>

<p>There a lot of nuances here, but this is a good overview to have in the back of your mind as you write code. And remember, the first goal is to get things working so if you accidentally put some logic in your view, don&rsquo;t sweat it.</p>

		<p><img class="center" src="http://31.media.tumblr.com/d619155808e29c0d5005f4f663d11114/tumblr_mjfgq0AcrB1qd5tdto1_250.gif"></p>

<p>Rails comes with a lot of magic. When I was learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails, I was taught Ruby first, moved up slowly, and then was shown that all the things I did the hard way could be done by typing ‚Äúrails generate‚Äù (or even just ‚Äúrails g‚Äù!). I think the way I learned was good, but listen ‚Äî we don‚Äôt have time for that right now, so we are just going to throw out this command and I will explain to you what it does. The deeper concepts can come later, but right now the most important thing is to get our hands dirty right away and generate a lot of code.</p>

<p>‚Äúrails generate‚Äù makes a lot of assumptions about what you might want in a robust web application and it generates things accordingly. There are more one-liners that can be used later to continue to expand your application as you need them.</p>

<p>The first command is <code>rails new</code>. <code>rails</code> tells your computer to use that code base and <code>new</code> is the command to generate a whole bunch of pre-written template code. You&rsquo;ll need one more thing after that, and it&rsquo;s your app name. So <code>rails new marleigh</code> will make all of those files generate in a folder called marleigh <em>in whatever directory you are currently in</em>. Make sure you know where you are in your terminal when you make this folder so you can find it again! If you aren&rsquo;t sure where you are, you can type <code>pwd</code>. That stands for &ldquo;print working directory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So <code>rails new</code> makes a lot of stuff. Do you need all of it? No. Shouldn&rsquo;t you be writing beautiful, minimalist, clean code from the very beginning? No. You will have plenty of time to craft elegant code in the future, but right now let&rsquo;s just get something running. It&rsquo;s easy to get caught up the former and never get to the latter.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/base_rails.png"></p>

<p>But what do we get?</p>

<p>On the left is an image of what gets generated when you run that one line. That&rsquo;s a lot of stuff! When I was cruising around on Github before learning anything about Rails, all of these files and folders scared the hell out of me. I also assumed they were all generated manually and that everyone knew everything about what all of these files and folders did and I had no idea where to look and I&rsquo;d never get anything right and was just a big dum-dum. That&rsquo;s wrong.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s right.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://33.media.tumblr.com/4256f4276b3aa11c3caf98a574a58296/tumblr_mjfgq0AcrB1qd5tdto5_250.gif"></p>

<p><strong>app</strong> &mdash; Most of your code will be written in this folder. It contains the models, controllers, and views, which are at the heart of the Rails framework. Another important folder within this one is the assets folder. There are other folders, too, but they are not required and you can ignore them for now. Just remember the MVC &mdash; we&rsquo;ll go into that later when we start writing. The assets folder is for putting your custom CSS, JavaScript, and images.</p>

<p><strong>bin</strong> &mdash; The code in this folder helps start up your app. If you have other things helping you out, they may needed to be booted up in here along with Rails. From the start, it&rsquo;ll have what you need to get things running.</p>

<p><strong>config</strong> &mdash; The config folder also gives you what you need to get off the ground, but very useful if you need to make modifications in the future, like because you are using a different server and need to change the database.yml file. There is one very important file in here, though, and it&rsquo;s routes.rb. You will be using it even for a basic application.</p>

<p><strong>db</strong> &mdash; Your database lives in this folder! seeds.rb is for populating seed data when you are testing.</p>

<p><strong>lib</strong> &mdash; Other libraries go here.</p>

<p><strong>log</strong> &mdash; Log files! You probably won&rsquo;t need to look at these very much initially, but be glad they are there.</p>

<p><strong>public</strong> &mdash; This is the only public part of your site. The rest of it is all hidden. Error pages, rules for robots like web scrapers, and your favicon (the tiny icon in the tab- section of your browser) live here by default.</p>

<p><strong>test</strong> &mdash; An important component to writing code is writing tests to make sure that code works. I&rsquo;m not gonna help you learn how to write tests, though.</p>

<p><strong>tmp</strong> &mdash; Don&rsquo;t worry about it. Just a spot for temporary files.</p>

<p><strong>vendor</strong> &mdash; This is where you put code libraries from other places, like if you use Bootstrap or a JavaScript library. It&rsquo;s the same as putting it in the Assets folder in /app but it&rsquo;s polite to put code you didn&rsquo;t write or generate into this folder. It also helps keep you organized.</p>

<p><strong>config.ru</strong> &mdash; The ru stands for rackup. This configures the application for use with Rack-based servers. It&rsquo;s set up as default.</p>

<p><strong>Gemfile</strong> &mdash; If your app uses other gems (Ruby libraries) to accomplish tasks, the names of those gems should go here so that it can be easily loaded by anyone wanting to use the application. The Gemfile.lock file is created after it is &ldquo;bundled.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Rakefile</strong> &mdash; If you find yourself doing a task frequently and want to automate it, you can turn it into a rake task. If you have one of those, you can put it here so that it loads along with your application.</p>

<p><strong>.gitignore</strong> &mdash; This is where you put files that you don&rsquo;t want to upload to git. This is in all git repositories, but Rails auto-populates it with stuff you never need to load to a public git directory.</p>

<p><strong>README</strong> &mdash; Documentation is important. This is a good place to put information about your app and how to use it.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://33.media.tumblr.com/7a224527d4b66b9987bb912262058de1/tumblr_mjfgq0AcrB1qd5tdto4_250.gif"></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still a lot all at once, right? And how do those pieces even work together?! That&rsquo;ll be what we go into next when we start writing code. A lot of this stuff <em>is</em> excessive for what you want to do, but it helps us get to the fun stuff right away.</p>

<p>The first link in the resources is great at explaining all of this in detail, so I recommend going over it (and over it and over it) to have a good understanding of how these parts work together.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://38.media.tumblr.com/8892c95636fd67bb843da6aa79c1ded4/tumblr_mjfgq0AcrB1qd5tdto2_250.gif"></p>

<p>When you‚Äôre making your first app, it‚Äôs hard to think about scope because it‚Äôs hard to know what is and isn‚Äôt possible. Some things that seem easy are hard, and vice versa. Marleigh mentioned an idea to me and fortunately it happened to be exactly the right size for a first-app: complex enough to cover all the concepts you need to be a great junior developer but simple enough to be able to tackle as a junior developer.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt want to give away her project idea, but when she told me what she wanted to build, I was able to break it down like this: Possible to execute in one or two pages, involves at least one API, logic is relatively simple but requires insight that she already has, database is not complex, is something she is personally interested in.</p>

<p>Here are a few things to try to keep in mind when planning out your first project:</p>

<ol>
<li>Keep it simple. Absolutely simple. There is a chance it‚Äôll be too simple, but it‚Äôs more likely that you will think of something that has a lot more moving parts than you‚Äôd expect.</li>
<li>Can this be done in one or two pages?</li>
<li>Logic. Can you figure out how to figure something out in advance? If you don‚Äôt know the answer, how are you going to be able to code it? One of the first apps I made involved a weather API and logic that would determine whether or not the average threshold for rainfall would exceed a certain limit, so you‚Äôd know whether or not you‚Äôd need an umbrella in the morning (and the application would fire a text only if that was the case). That was something my team could easily figure out. You‚Äôll be worried about figuring out a lot of stuff, so don‚Äôt make a complex problem part of it. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with ripping off something that already exists because the important part is your learning.</li>
<li>Be interested. Be something you actually want to use and be proud of. This is kind of a no-brainer because you‚Äôre obviously making this app for you in your spare time while learning how to code, but it‚Äôs worth emphasizing. Do something related to what you love.</li>
</ol>


<p>Scoping is hard whether you are a junior or a senior developer: there&rsquo;s always going to be hiccups that you didn&rsquo;t expect or things that were much easier than anticipated. It gets easier, but it will never be easy (kinda like programming, if you&rsquo;re doing it right).</p>

<p>Bonus points: APIs. This is also good for thinking up an idea: find an API that is well-made and build something based on it. You certainly don‚Äôt need to use an API for your app but I can tell you that when I was interviewing for my first developer job out of school, APIs were a hot topic. (A lot of questions about whether I‚Äôd made my own before.)</p>

<p> Disclaimer: I love this part. I love setting up environments, I love debugging problems on the command line*, and I love working on server-side problems. Ever since I was a kid. Weird, right? Most people don‚Äôt feel that way (or lacked the opportunity). And it‚Äôs hella intimidating to start your coding journey by having to stare at a huge black screen* that you don‚Äôt understand. I also used DOS when I started using computers, so it was comforting to me, a familiar screen, and even working in the terminal* now gives me this strong sense of nostalgia for childhood. SO NERDY. Most people have only used graphical user interfaces to interact with their computer, so typing things into the shell* is definitely weird.</p>

<p>Weird and scary. Because you&rsquo;re looking at an empty black box, typing into the darkness, it can be intimidating because of a slight fear that you&rsquo;ll do something wrong and ruin your entire computer. This is highly, highly, highly unlikely. Everyone starting out gets the disclaimer of being wary of commands that start with <code>rm</code> (remove), and you could end up in black holes that takes a few hours to get out of because of debugging, but be brave and go forth! Environment problems don&rsquo;t take a long time because you are stupid. They take a long time because the computer is stupid and needs explicit instructions.</p>

<p>It seems like programming is a lot like the opening gif, up above. You don&rsquo;t have to be Commander Data to use the command line, though. And a lot of environment setup involves pressing a button and waiting a while. We&rsquo;re gonna have you up and running like this&hellip; in theory.</p>

<p><img src="http://38.media.tumblr.com/ed6df7c82c24e812dfe3c5892a65bcb8/tumblr_mohoyw4X0l1s67vyfo4_250.gif" alt="Data pressing a button" /></p>

<p>The final and most difficult part about setup is that in theory it‚Äôs easy. In theory, you just run a few lines and everything is totally fine and your computer is like :) complete! :) installed! :) good! :). But most of the time, you get some crazy  jargon.</p>

<p>First rule: Read what the computer gives back to you! This is the best thing you can learn from setting up your environment (assuming you run into problems). Your computer will tell you what‚Äôs wrong. Sometimes it‚Äôs good at articulating its feelings. Sometimes its not so good. It just a computer, after all. It doesn‚Äôt really have feelings. But when you get an error message, don‚Äôt panic!</p>

<p>Second step: If you have no idea what the computer is trying to tell you, google it. Google the shit out of it. Copy-paste that shit right into google and you‚Äôre most likely to get a link to StackOverflow with someone else that had your same problem. Especially when you‚Äôre learning early on ‚Äî at least one person, usually many people, have had the same problems you are having right now. And some kind person out there, again usually on StackOverflow, has already gently explained the right thing to do in order to fix it. If you don‚Äôt understand what they are saying, keep scrolling or start googling what they are saying. Just google forever. Or use your preferred search engine.</p>

<p>Enough of these steps, let&rsquo;s get practical. Pop open that terminal open! (Use Spotlight to search for Terminal, or you can find Terminal.app in your applications folder <strong>in the Utilities folder</strong>). Windows users, sorry I am leaving you in the dust here.</p>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s install <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>. Follow the commands on the page and listen to anything the command line gives back to you. Homebrew is great. It&rsquo;s a package manager. What does that mean? It means you can add things to your computer that you need without having to do all the work yourself, or running into problems. So when you want to install a new programming lanuage or component, you can do it with one line. Overall, from a new-user perspective, it helps protect your machine from you. It makes command-lining like a wild beast (as a new user) much safer.</p>

<p><img src="http://emojipedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/160x160xbeer-mug.png.pagespeed.ic.kOjM-Un-7l.jpg" alt="beer" /></p>

<p>I think you might need to install X-Code. This will vary based on your operating system. See the resources below if you have trouble doing this.</p>

<p>When Homebrew is up and running, you can use it to install Ruby, RVM (this manages), and Rails by running <code>brew install</code> and the thing you want to install. Rather than repeating how to do this from memory, I recommend following the guides I link to at the bottom of this post.</p>

<p>* I realize that people commonly use several words to refer to the same thing: that black (by default) screen you use to manipulate your computer, with only text on it. On OS X (Mac) operating systems, the application is called <strong>Terminal</strong>. Inside, it uses the <strong>shell</strong> (Unix term for a user interface for accessing your computer). There are a few language structures used in shell, but the most common (and default) is called <strong>bash</strong> (which is a free, open-source alternative of the Bourne shell, which is why bash stands for Bourne-again-shell). All of this brings together the ability to manipulate your computer via the <strong>command-line</strong> (as opposed to using your mouse to click where you want to go ‚Äî that uses the graphical user interface).</p>

<p>Windows is a different beast, of course, but it might be the beast you are stuck with. On Windows, you are looking for the Command Prompt (found via this path: Start > All Programs > Accessories > Command Prompt, if I recall correctly).</p>

<p><img src="http://emojipedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/160x160xclinking-beer-mugs.png.pagespeed.ic.Gv-8d6e0qe.jpg" alt="clinking beer" /></p>

<p>Although most learning can be done alone, it&rsquo;s a bit of a bummer that setting up the environment is like being forced to dive head-first into the deep end without even ever having been in the water before, much less know how to swim. If you are a non-Marleigh following along with these posts, it&rsquo;s best to try to find a friend or resource that can sit next to you and explain things. If you have no friends (that know about this stuff), you can ask me! But remember firstly that search engines are also your friend.</p>

<p>Happy new year.</p>

<ol>
<li>I have a friend who wants to learn how to code.</li>
<li>She has an app in mind that she wants to create.</li>
<li>One of my goals for the new year is to write more technical blog posts.</li>
</ol>


<p>We also live pretty far apart ‚Äî I live in New York and she lives in my home state of South Carolina (at least, for now). I think one of the best ways to help her make her app is to write blog posts explaining some of the concepts that were new to me when I was learning how to code. Ruby on Rails is one of the easiest frameworks to learn for a couple of reasons: it teaches you the core concepts of programming for the web, Ruby is one of the easiest languages to learn as a beginner (if not the easiest), and Rails is robust enough to get a fully functioning application off the ground in the matter of a few weeks, even for people new to coding. And it‚Äôs just easier for me to write if I can pretend like I‚Äôm speaking to one person directly.</p>

<p>Another important note: my friend is a real Star Trek: The Next Generation nerd, so if you see an obtuse amount of TNG references and gifs on this blog in the near future&hellip; that is why.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs the rough framework I will use to explain how to make an app while keeping it general enough for anyone (and obviously subject to change).</p>
