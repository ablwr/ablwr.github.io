	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><em>Why won’t Octopress just upload my images?!?!?!?!?!?!, or how I learned to stop worrying and love the source.</em></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/glitch1.png"></p>

<p>I’ve been using Git for a while and I feel like I have a good grasp on it. I’ve also been using Octopress for a while, integrated into Github pages, and I feel like I have a good grasp on it, too. Rake tasks, right? I’ve WRITTEN rake tasks before! I got this! But for some reason, uploading images for me always seemed like it was a miracle that would work sometimes and not work at other times. Y’know… computer magic.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/glitch2.png"></p>

<p>Sometimes it would just straight up EAT my images and I’d have to remake a screen cap and get angry and keep pounding my head against the code-wall. That’s dumb, though. That’s no way to solve a problem, especially when dealing with logical beasts that perform as instructed. But I wasn’t sure what I was doing wrong. I would just keep moving things around and committing until it seemed to give up and take my images.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/glitch3.png"></p>

<p>It’s just not a good way to live.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/glitch4.png"></p>

<p>Are you having this problem, too? I decided to figure it out.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/glitch5.png"></p>

<p>I was dropping my images in the wrong file! With Octopress, there are a lot of potential places to put images. It’s tempting to put it in public/images folder. It’s also tempting to put it in the _deploy/images folder. Those are bad, though. Those are bad. You want to put it in the SOURCE folder. If you stick images in source/images, they will get picked up when running rake generate / rake deploy. If they go anywhere else, the rake task doesn’t know what to do so it just overwrites them and your images will just disappear.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/glitch6.png"></p>

<p>Maybe this is a no-brainer, but sometimes I feel like a no-brainer, myself.</p>

<h1>P.S.</h1>

<p>Another note! It&rsquo;s important to use the right syntax when adding images. One method in Markdown is to use this syntax:</p>

<p> <code>![netflixforbooks](images/markdown.png)</code></p>

<p>But for Octopress, you want to use this:</p>

<p> <img class="left" src="/images/markdown.png"></p>

<p>Otherwise, images will work on the front page of your blog but they won&rsquo;t work when you visit the individual pages. The more you know&hellip;!</p>

<ul>
<li>I had to use an image tag because otherwise Markdown automatically transforms it into regular html, aka <code>&lt;img class="center" src="/images/markdown.png"&gt;</code></li>
</ul>

		<p><img class="center" src="/images/oyster.png"></p>

<p>I came up with an idea to make a spoof/parody of the recently launched <a href="https://www.oysterbooks.com">Oyster</a>, a company that purports to be the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/07/technology/personaltech/aiming-to-be-the-netflix-of-books.html">“Netflix of books,”</a> allowing rentable access to digital books. This hit a sore spot among the librarians I know (and as a former librarian, I know many), because one of the biggest struggles in the field is increasing awareness in the capabilities of the modern library. Most libraries HAVE eBook access, plenty of it, and a lot of materials can be accessed through a library’s website without even having to go into the library. I think a service like Oyster has a lot of value, but I wanted to remind people that they can utilize the free resources available nearby.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/worldcat.png"></p>

<p>So, I basically just made a splash page for WorldCat. WorldCat is a collective catalog used by over 72,000 libraries. Searching a book on WorldCat, a user can add their zip code and find the closest location of that resource, so she could know exactly where to go to pick it up. If I look up Harry Potter and request the eBook format, I can see that its available at several libraries near me, one of which is the Brooklyn Public Library. Assuming the user has a library card, she can just log in and get the book onto her preferred digital book reader in very little time. WorldCat is great, but its underused (just like our local libraries). It&rsquo;s also kinda ugly, so why not make it hip to modern internet eyes?</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/netflixforbooks.png"></p>

<p>I really wanted to integrate the WorldCat API into this project, but unfortunately the API is not open and available to the public. This isn’t the time or place to ramble on about the benefits of open source and open access to databases and applications, but I would have been able to put a lot more time and effort into making a more beautiful and friendlier front-end for the face of public libraries. Alas, alas.</p>

<p>Let’s use libraries!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>To follow up my last <a href="http://ablwr.github.io/blog/2014/09/18/breaking-it-down/">blog about blogging</a> (meta), here is the blog post I originally intended to write. I’m pushing it up the queue over the other 13 pending posts.</p>

<p>Flatiron School was hard. It was one of the toughest, enduring challenges I’ve ever done in my life, and also the most rewarding. I got completely comfortable working from 8am to 10pm every day, excited to write code and build stuff and make things happen. After graduation, it can be hard to not lose that momentum.</p>

<p>Before coming to Flatiron, I had a regular 9-5 job as cataloging manager at a film archive. On top of that, I did some freelance consulting work. Well, it was really more like sub-consulting, if that is a thing. Anyway, I worked a lot independently. I have a couple of friends that, for a while, paid for desks at a coworking space here in New York and it was hard for me to understand how someone could justify paying so much money for a desk while freelancing instead of just working from home (and thus having to work less because you don&rsquo;t have to work the extra amount it takes to pay for the coworking space desk). I could understand the social benefits of working around others, but overall I just never understood the &ldquo;going to a coffee shop to work&rdquo; thing. Throughout college, I always worked from my dorm or house and hardly set foot in the library except to grab up books (which is kinda funny, since I have an advanced degree in library and information science now). Back to the point: I started getting paid to work, which means I had to pay attention to what I was doing and work efficiently. With personal projects or homework, it&rsquo;s fine to dabble around. But when it&rsquo;s business, I knew I had to stay focused or I&rsquo;d have to start billing half-hours, which means I&rsquo;d work for 4 hours but only really work for 2, which is a waste of my own time because all 4 hours certainly still felt like I was working, even if half of it was non-billed procrastination time. I also have two cats. They are very cute, but they are also capable of being very annoying.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is how I discovered the joy of having a space dedicated to just working and I renounced all negative vibes I had towards paying $500 for a desk in Brooklyn. Back in South Carolina, I worked for a University on weekdays and spent my weekends working on projects at the University library. I&rsquo;d work from home on weeknights, but it was so much harder to get things done when I kept getting distracted by little things like dirty dishes, crooked books on a shelf, making tea, neighbors, or cats. Mostly the cats.</p>

<p>Getting back to the point&hellip; after Flatiron, we were welcome to continue working on campus, which is great! Fortunately for me and 15 other recently minted lady developers, I was selected to participate in the <a href="http://flatironschool.com/fogcreek">Flatiron / Fog Creek Fellowship</a>.</p>

<p>Here is what we all get, according to the website:</p>

<blockquote><p>What Fellows get:</p>

<p>• A dedicated mentor from both the Fog Creek and Trello teams</p>

<p>• Events with the Fog Creek and Trello staff including Cofounders Joel Spolsky and Michael Pryor</p>

<p>• A desk at Fog Creek</p>

<p>• Daily lunch</p>

<p>• Technical interview practice and guidance</p>

<p>• Four 1:1 pairing sessions</p>

<p>• Help choosing and feedback on a side project</p>

<p>• 1:1 lunch with your mentor every other week</p></blockquote>

<p>To summarize: A desk, a lunch, a dude telling you stuff. To be honest, I wasn&rsquo;t sure how this was going to go down at first. To be even more honest, I was a little sad to be separated from my Flatiron classmates that would still be working at the home base. But the baby bird has to leave the nest sometime&hellip; I was kinda excited about the desk, though. Because I knew being out of the Flatiron work-all-the-time mode was going to be hard, and not having a dedicated space to work was going to be even harder. Looking for a job is hard and I am just as busy now as I was when I was still in the program.</p>

<p>I missed the fellowship orientation because I was driving from South Carolina to New York with two desks to not-work-at-home-at and two cats, among other things, so I was a little nervous to just pop right into such a highly regarded software company.</p>

<p>Immediately, though, I was made to feel SO WELCOME. My mentor is SUPER RAD, he sent me a bunch of emails in advance, he read through my blog and had a lot of questions to ask me. He is always ready to sit down with me at any time to teach me some of the more theory-heavy aspects of computer programming that I mostly missed out on, to ask me about how my job search is going, or to just make me watch the first ten minutes of Up and explain how it relates to software engineering AND LIFE. Everyone at Fog Creek / Trello has been SOOOO extremely nice and welcoming, and I am so happy to be participating in the inaugural fellowship. The mentors all got together and came up with a dedicated time (and trello board) to helping all of us collectively train up on Computer Science fundamentals.</p>

<p>It truly feels like a fellowship, by the academic definition. We all get access to resources like desks and lunch and an unlimited snack bar (oh god, the snack bar, the snack bar&hellip;) and open access to a very nice espresso machine, but more importantly we get things like Joel Spolsky personally teaching us how to use the espresso machine (something that I think many established software engineers have dreamt about at night), casual lunch conversations about time travel (this comes up a lot), talent shows, board game nights, and Friday socials.</p>

<p>So&hellip; what&rsquo;s the lesson from this blog post? Desks are important for working hard, but more important than a desk and a space is the people that you surround yourself with when working, so I&rsquo;m thrilled to get to regularly hang with such a great team of people while I work on finding a place to work. Thank you so much, Flatiron and Fog Creek &amp; Trello!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>When I started at the Flatiron School in June, I told myself I was going to blog about my feelings and what I was learning every week. EVERY week. Then, when I graduated and inevitably had not written a single blog post about how it was going, I said I was gonna write a big ol’ jumbo blog post about the whole twelve weeks and everything I learned and how amazing it was.</p>

<p>Anyway, I graduated a month ago and there is still no e-novella.</p>

<p>This covers two important lessons in programming:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Don’t get into code debt.</strong> If I had worked a little bit at a time towards my goal, I would have a weekly summary of what I was learning and doing while at Flatiron. But to speak to the other side of code debt: not writing about my experience was a bummer, but I was definitely spending it learning how to be a better programmer, which was the higher priority at the time, so I don’t feel too bad about it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Break problems down into smaller problems.</strong> Since I wasn’t a diligent blogger, I wanted to just write one big post about Flatiron. But that’s such a large task! There’s SO much I want to cover, so where would I even begin? The most important advice I have to regularly give myself is to break problems down into smaller problems, otherwise I potentially get overwhelmed and not know where to start, which would result in just never starting.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Anyway, I hope to get those blog posts out in the world soon. If you are reading this because you are doing some cyber-research on the Flatiron School and are thinking of applying, do not hesitate for one second to get in touch! I love talking about it. I just haven&rsquo;t had the time to sit down and really blog it out.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Basically, I have a history of taking jokes too far. See also: <a href="http://instagram.com/p/ruP0rHjtbO/?modal=true">Tattoos of Avi’s face</a>. So when I was exploring <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>’s <a href="http://popcornjs.org">Popcorn.js</a> and missing my Flatiron peers, I coded up a small app that would help me learn how to use Popcorn.js aaaaaaaand also troll my friends.</p>

<p>At Flatiron, we used a shared playlist system called <a href="http://sonos.com">Sonos</a>. Everyone could add tracks from online music collections like Spotify, Hype Machine, or Songza. Near the last third of the semester, as we were all on the brink of insanity and exhaustion, one song in particular kept making a rude appearance. I don’t know who started it or why, but the entire Flatiron office had to suffer through many, many, many instances of Seal’s Kiss from a Rose.</p>

<p>After Flatiron graduation, I was pretty excited to dig into some new projects while on the job hunt, but really missed hanging out with all of my Flatiron buds. To alleviate my withdrawl symptoms, I decided to integrate my Popcorn.js learning into an app to basically troll everyone I know.</p>

<p>To troll successfully, though, I first had to troll myself. Because music videos on youtube don&rsquo;t come with subtitles, I had to make those subtitles happen manually. I once had a job transcribing interviews, so I&rsquo;m pretty fast. But to get the timing right, I still had to submit myself to many, many listens of the same song.</p>

<p>Popcorn.js makes it easy to add supplemental media to video files based on timing.</p>

<p>Within a document listener, you create an instance variable with the .youtube suffix (obviously it&rsquo;s different if you are not using the YouTube API to access a video, but for this example, I used YouTube) and then declare a landing div ID and a link to the video itself.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'>   <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">pop</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">Popcorn</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">youtube</span><span class="p">(</span>
</span><span class='line'>     <span class="s1">&#39;#video&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>     <span class="s1">&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4tTnIimi8E&#39;</span> <span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Afterwards, it&rsquo;s time to start adding footnotes! This takes in four options &mdash; a start time (in seconds), an end time (also in seconds, big surprise), the text you want to display, and the target div. The application of subtitle footnotes is simple, but it&rsquo;s easy to see what kind of complex and interesting things can be done based on video playback times.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'>   <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">footnote</span><span class="p">({</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nx">start</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">94</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nx">end</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">97</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nx">text</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Won&#39;t you tell me is that healthy, baby?&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nx">target</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;footnotediv&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="p">})</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p> At the end, just trigger play.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">pop</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">play</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Try it yourself! <a href="http://ablwr.github.io/flatiron-karaoke">Sing your heart out here</a>.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also an easter egg, but you have to patiently wait for it (or sing sing sing for it).</p>

<p>User feedback: It worked! Everyone typed in a song and got Seal back and tried it again because they thought it was a bug. NOPE. The only person that didn’t get trolled had preemptively trolled by searching for “Kiss from a Rose” so she didn’t know it was the only possible song that could be returned.</p>

<p>In the future, I’d like to spend more time trying to figure out how a real karaoke app could be created by automatically generating accurate subtitles. I’d also like to spend more time on the CSS styles so I could figure out how to fake the text highlighting on karaoke videos. As I mentioned earlier, there&rsquo;s an easter egg &mdash; I&rsquo;d like to work on incorporating more complex supplemental data alongside video files, such as Google maps, Wikipedia page load triggers, and images.</p>

		<p><a href="https://github.com/antiboredom/videogrep">Videogrep</a> is a Python-based application that searches through a video file using its subtitles track and can cut video clips based on its search criteria.</p>

<p>Videogrep is SUPER easy to use&hellip; as long as ffmpeg is installed properly. If not, prepare for some configuring and installing.</p>

<p>I used videogrep to search through one of my favorite movies, Terrorvision, to find every time a character refers to something as &ldquo;The Pleasure (noun).&rdquo; Hint: it happens more times than you would think.</p>

<p>To do this, I only had to type one line and videogrep did the rest of the work.</p>

<p><code>python videogrep.py -i Terrorvision/Terrorvision.avi -o test_video.mp4 --search 'Pleasure'</code></p>

<p>If there is an error, at this point it will let you know. But if all goes well, the following will print to the screen:</p>

<p><code>Your video is ready ! Fingers crossed for the Oscars !</code></p>

<p>Here is the video supercut. Something that might have taken a few hours for me to piece together using my memory of the movie and video editing software was done in less than a minute using the powers of Python and FFMpeg.</p>

<p>Voila!</p>

<p> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/99057389">Pleasure Supercut</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/orangelazarus">Ashley Blewer</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p></p>

<p>This was just a simple example, but videogrep can get more specific based on the regular expression added into the search string. In the above example, I knew &ldquo;Pleasure&rdquo; was a proper noun because its the name of many rooms in the Putterman household. If I really wanted to grab every instance of the word, I would have had to search for &lsquo;pleasure|Pleasure&rsquo; to capture both uppercase and lowercase.</p>

<p>Videogrep can be even more powerful because it understands <a href="http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pages/pattern-search">pattern recognition using pattern search</a>. I was able to extract what I wanted by just typing in one word, but it also understands word patterns. For example, you can use flags like JJ for adjective or NN for noun and it will extract every instance of a particular speech pattern.</p>

<p>It can also search for hypernyms, which are words that fit into a certain category and have a semantic relation to each other. For example, if you searched for automobile, you might also want to extract similar words like car, truck, or van. If you weren&rsquo;t picky about what kind of bird you were looking for, a hypernym search would result in crows, seagulls, and eagles.</p>

<p>Enjoy using videogrep and watch out for the monster!</p>

		<p>When walking to and from class every day at the bottom of Manhattan, I&rsquo;ve noticed plates of text on the ground with a date and name of a famous person. I didn&rsquo;t realize what these signs were about until I was walking out of the southmost Bowling Green stop and saw the initial plaque on the ground:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/canyon-of-heroes.jpg" title="" ></p>

<p>After that, everything clicked! They are commemorating every ticker-tape parade held on Broadway, starting with the first to commemorate the dedication of the Statue of Liberty in 1886.</p>

<p>Before I came to the Flatiron School, I was working as a moving image archivist. I primarily worked with collections of newsreels from the 1920s and 1930s. My job was to catalog them and put them online for access. When I realized what the text on the ground stood for, I immediately ALSO realized that I recognized so many of the names because I had seen some of the actual parades happen (on film)! The text that struck me the most while walking up the street was this one:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/canyon_of_heroes_amelia.jpg" title="" ></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve <em>definitely</em> watched this footage. I ran to the (digital) archive and sure enough, <a href="http://mirc.sc.edu/islandora/object/usc%3A1866">there it was</a>.</p>

<p>Footage identification can be difficult when you don&rsquo;t have a lead, but this connection was pretty easy to make. I watched the footage, paying attention to the structures of the buildings, and then pulled up Flatiron School&rsquo;s address on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@40.705328,-74.013743,3a,75y,222.42h,90.24t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sxgNehf6c2LCLopGdOjKqkQ!2e0!6m1!1e1">Google Streetview</a>. Boom! It was a total match!</p>

<p>Here is a screencap of the Amelia Earheart ticker-tape parade superimposed on top of Google streetview.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/broadway_thenandnow.png" title="" ></p>

<p>Pretty cool!</p>

<p>Bonus: The building that the Flatiron School is located in used to be the office building for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Star_Line">White Star Line</a>, which built the RMS Titanic (and many other, sturdier ships). Cool!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Forms are hard! Forms are confusing in real life as well as on (or behind) the web. One problem with building web forms in Rails for me was that there are too many options! There are three distinct ways to create forms. And it’s also hard to tell which options are optional and which ones are required. Additionally, the syntax isn&rsquo;t always the same, so it can be hard to remember three different ways to do the same thing without mixing them up, especially as a beginner.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/basic_form.png" title="" ></p>

<p>Here is the first form. This is the form that I think most people in my Ruby005 class would have written last week, before we learned about Rails form helpers. This is a form at its lowest level of abstraction while still being partially in Ruby, although it lacks Rails form helpers and form options helpers. This form just iterates through each ingredient and creates a checkbox. Checkboxes gives value of 1 if checked, 0 if not. And in the controller, we have to add ingredient_ids as an empty array in the params. It has to be called that or the whole thing won&rsquo;t work and all this code will be for naught.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/form_tag.png" title="" ></p>

<p>Collection_check_boxes takes in five arguments, object, method, collection, value_method, text_method. Above, the recipe is the object, the ingredients_ids are the method, Ingredient.all is the collection, the :id is the value of the checkbox, and the name is the text to display with the checkbox. Best practice would be to abstract away the collection here so you are not calling a class in your View, and make a variable for Ingredient.all. Collection_check_boxes can look cumbersome with its five arguments, but its much cleaner than the previous code.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/form_for.png" title="" ></p>

<p>In form_for, it looks like collection_check_boxes only takes FOUR arguments. And when you’re in formland, that’s an easy way to remember. Form_FOR takes FOUR. It actually takes five arguments, but one has already been declared at the beginning of the form. It’s @recipe.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s plenty more to learn about forms and form helpers, but I hope this little post can clear up some of the confusion surrounding usage.</p>
