	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>A month ago, I was (lightly, &hellip;I think) called out for bailing on speaking about <a href="www.bavc.org/qctools">QCTools</a> for the Association of Moving Image Archivists conference. Nevermind the bait-and-switch last-minute-surprise-you’re-speaking scenario I had landed myself in and that I really really did want to see my pals give a talk on BitTorrent and private tracker communities as archives, I did still feel a twinge of guilt for dropping out last minute. Sorry, guys. The BitTorrent panel was pretty baller, though.</p>

<p>To make up for it, I am here today on this blog to talk about how you, non-technical or kinda-technical or just-scared-of-git person, can dig in and support open source projects like QCTools, even if you don’t speak C++ (which is what I started planning for in the 2-day scramble before leaving New York on a jet plane).</p>

<p>Here it is:</p>

<p>I think a lot of people are intuitively intimidated by using git because it can be hard to understand or because they don’t know how to read code. But not being able to read code is okay because you can still make valuable contributions in English! One of the biggest sore spots for most open source software (and even proprietary software) is a lack of clear, concise documentation. But at least with OSS, if something in the documentation is confusing, instead of going on Twitter or something and being like “wah wah this free thing I downloaded totally sucks,” you can actually go in there and CHANGE it. Or at least make a request to change it.</p>

<p>I’m gonna go through how you might make those changes without having to do anything “techy.”</p>

<p>Uh, so I went to the Flatiron School which is an immersive web development program. This is how I did things on Day 1 as a shortcut to getting what I wanted (which was to deploy a user profile for myself)*. I can’t get away with that stuff now but you totally can. It’s not bad practice or anything (well, maybe the context in which I was doing it was, but that&rsquo;s neither here nor there). Actually, I did a quick edit like this today because I wanted to fix someone else’s documentation but I didn’t want to bother going through all the other steps to copy and download the repository to my local machine.</p>

<p>* One thousand blessings to Dave Rice for being extremely patient with me when I made my first changes to the QCTools documentation by submitting weird pull requests even though he had given me permission to upload directly because I didn&rsquo;t know how to push directly to the master branch.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/readme.png"></p>

<p>The main block of text on the front of a Github repository is located in the README.md file. (The .md stands for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>, a way to format writing on the web easily. (<a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">cheatsheet here</a>)) If you click on the link, it&rsquo;ll take you to a page that only loads the README. On the right side, above the beginning of the document, there is a little pencil button. That pencil allows you to go in and edit the file without having to load the repository on your computer, use the command line, or even use the Github desktop GUI.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/edit_pencil.png"></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right, click on that pencil! You&rsquo;ll open into an in-browser text editor. It&rsquo;s pretty much the same as editing a wiki. Which you&rsquo;ve totally done, right? Just make your changes right in there. At the bottom, fill out a brief, one-line description of the change you made and why you made it and add a longer description if necessary. By the way, you can use emoji in here. Use <a href="http://emoji-cheat-sheet.com">this cheat sheet</a>.</p>

<p>When you click the &ldquo;Commit changes&rdquo; button, you&rsquo;ll get a notification from Github saying that you can&rsquo;t directly contribute to the code so it has forked the repository for you and has made your changes on your branch. Does that sound confusing? Forks, branches? It just means that you aren&rsquo;t allowed to directly change the code and there&rsquo;s a process in place to make sure that only good code goes in. Everything is copied to your account and you make the changes on YOUR account. If you want the changes to go into the main product, you have to submit a pull request (just follow the steps). It&rsquo;s a pull request because you are asking the owners of the main github page to &ldquo;pull in&rdquo; changes that you made on your copy of their main codebase.</p>

<p>Got a problem? Yo, you&rsquo;ll solve it! Check out this next step while the DJ revolves it:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/diff.png"></p>

<p>The red is what I took away from the code and the green is what I added in.</p>

<p>After you submit a pull request, people can comment on it before it can get merged into the master branch. If the code change might cause a problem (or in the case of non-technical edits, if the documentation is wrong), conversations can happen here. This peer-review process helps keep open source projects strong and sturdy. Here is someone coming in to critique my simple edit soon after I opened the pull request on it for being too verbose:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/codereview.png"></p>

<p>He was right, I could make the line even simpler and not even get into the fact that the code could run in another Terminal window, so I changed my change (the screencap above was taken after that). I even changed my change after this because it still had a lingering backtick in it, as you can see in this screencap. If you change something, you don&rsquo;t have to re-open a pull request. The pull request takes the latest version of your code on your branch and assumes it is ready to move into the master if the pull request is approved. At this point, all you can do is wait and feel good about your open source contribution.</p>

<p>If you want to add to the QCTools documentation, you can follow the same steps. With QCTools, the documentation is hidden a little deeper into the codebase, but you can find it <a href="https://github.com/bavc/qctools/tree/master/Source/Resource/Help">here in the Source</a>. You have to follow the rules and the code has to validate to proper HTML, but changes are easy and possible.</p>

<p>If you are afraid to make your change, go ahead and try to change anything on any of the repositories I own. I think I even have one called <a href="https://github.com/ablwr/testing">testing</a>. You can&rsquo;t test out submitting pull requests on your own github folders because you already own them (which was disappointing when I was trying to pull together screen caps for this demo).</p>

<p>If there’s something bigger you want to fix but you don’t know how to do it, you can open an issue. This may or may not be fulfilled and it might take a while to fulfill. Obviously the best way to fix a problem is by doing it yourself. But this is a good way to provide feedback on how something like QCTools works and bring up problems that might be easy to fix by someone else. You can see that QCTools has plenty of <a href="https://github.com/bavc/qctools/issues">open issues</a> at the moment.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/issues.png"></p>

<p>The issues page is on the right-hand side of a Github repository. You can access it to see all the current issues or make your own.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/issues2.png"></p>

<p>You can see Github has a lot of issues that I added to the repository earlier today. UX needs help, people! To create a new issue, click on the New Issue tab (I didn&rsquo;t need to explain that to you, did I?)</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/issues3.png"></p>

<p>To create a good issue that people will actually pay attention to, try to make the problem specific but concise. If it&rsquo;s a bug in the program, explain exactly what you were doing to cause the error to occur and make sure to mention if you are able to make the bug repeat, or if it only happened once and not again. If you know someone is in charge of a certain aspect of a project, assign them to it. If you don&rsquo;t know, though, don&rsquo;t assign anybody and someone in charge of the project can always direct the issue to the right person or someone else can jump in to fix it. Also, don&rsquo;t follow my above example and only submit an issue if it&rsquo;s something important that will help contribute overall to the betterment of the project.</p>

<p>A final note: One thing that guides to Github or Open Source contribution usually fail to mention is that it&rsquo;s scary. It&rsquo;s SCARY, dude. It involves being assertive, telling a total stranger that you think you have a better solution to their problem, and envoking feedback from anyone in the world that cares about the project. I don&rsquo;t have much advice for this other than BE BRAVE, close your eyes, and CLICK that button (or buttons) and don&rsquo;t worry if someone wants to try to get into a fight with you on the internet. The worst thing that can happen is that you&rsquo;re wrong, and that&rsquo;s okay too. And most people are exceptionally nice and willing to work it out with you (like Dave Rice).</p>

<p>The biggest advice I can give is don&rsquo;t worry about fucking things up. It&rsquo;s git. It&rsquo;s a distributed revision control system. It&rsquo;s entire purpose for existing is to protect against things getting fucking up.</p>

<p>Extra final note: I&rsquo;m leading a skillshare on git later this month so expect more git-based tutorials or resources to come!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Last week, I participated in the second <a href="http://wiki.curatecamp.org/index.php?title=Association_of_Moving_Image_Archivists_%26_Digital_Library_Federation_Hack_Day_2014">AMIA AV Hack Day</a> and paired up with NCSU libriarian/developer Jason Ronallo, CNN archivist/engineer Nicholas Zoss, and CNN archivist/engineer/manager Jay Brown. Building on Ronallo&rsquo;s <a href="http://ronallo.com/blog/a-plugin-for-mediaelement-js-for-preview-thumbnails-on-hover-over-the-time-rail/">work with WebVTT and video scrolling thumbnails</a>, we created a Ruby gem that exports thumbnail images, thumbnail sprite image, and a WebVTT metadata file with synced media fragment URLs to thumbnails within the sprite. This could allow for the integration of video thumbnail creation to happen automatically within the web access video workflow. It is also easy to install and use, making it accessible to a wider audience (always a primary goal of mine).</p>

<p>One of the things I am most proud of is how seamlessly our team was able to distribute work and pair together when necessary. I was able to jump right in as the junior developer role, helping as support and Ruby syntax consultant, as well as filling out documentation and other smaller tasks. Jason Ronallo steered the ship, but welcomed many proofreading eyes to look over his code for debugging. Nick Zoss contributed plenty of engineering knowledge and helped do &ldquo;all the math parts.&rdquo; Jay Brown went to work finding and creating sample videos for testing the scripts and worked on general QA. And at the crucial end point of the day, I wrangled Dave Rice to quickly act as ffmpeg script consultant (a cool trick I learned and helped my team win one of the awards from <a href="http://wiki.curatecamp.org/index.php?title=Association_of_Moving_Image_Archivists_%26_Digital_Library_Federation_Hack_Day_2013">the first AV Hack Day</a>).</p>

<p>Anyway, let&rsquo;s get down to it! This is how the app works. It&rsquo;s EASY! After you <code>gem install video-sprites</code>, you can run it in your terminal (assuming you have ffmpeg and ImageMagick installed and working)</p>

<p>For example, I ran this: <code>video-sprites -i /Users/ashley/Development/kiss_from_a_rose.mpg -o /Users/ashley/Development</code></p>

<p>And I got this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/rose_export.png"></p>

<p>Simple, right? And check it out&hellip;</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>00:00:00.000 --&gt; 00:00:05.000
</span><span class='line'>http://example.com/kiss_from_a_rose-sprite-00001.jpg#xywh=0,0,200,133
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>00:00:05.000 --&gt; 00:00:10.000
</span><span class='line'>http://example.com/kiss_from_a_rose-sprite-00001.jpg#xywh=200,0,200,133
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>00:00:10.000 --&gt; 00:00:15.000
</span><span class='line'>http://example.com/kiss_from_a_rose-sprite-00001.jpg#xywh=400,0,200,133</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There&rsquo;s also this WebVTT file! If I replace the example.com with the website that is hosting the image sprite (or had I specified it when I ran the gem using the -u or &mdash;url flag), I could integrate it into a scrolling video thumbnail feature!</p>

<p>Play around with it yourself! The <a href="https://github.com/jronallo/video-sprites">code is up on Github</a> and we welcome feedback. Moving forward, there&rsquo;s a lot to do to keep this gem in tip-top shape and there are many features we plan to add. Like a good junior developer, I&rsquo;ve given myself the goal of writing tests to make it a healthy and happy gem. Oh, tests&hellip;</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Last week, I was in converesation with some peers in the moving image archiving, preservation, conservation, (et al&hellip;) field and we were discussing ways to improve and empower the roles that women in the field have. One of the things that came up was it&rsquo;d be interesting to see the breakdown over time of the people presenting at the annual <a href="http://amianet.org">Association of Moving Image Archivists</a> <a href="http://www.amiaconference.com">conference</a> and whether it was appropriately stacked in terms of gender.</p>

<p>With around 200 speakers, it would be great if I could just grab this data algorithmically and not have to parse it piece-by-piece using my slow human brain! Over the weekend, I went to work combining Ruby web scraping tool, <a href="http://nokogiri.org/">Nokogiri</a>, with a library that does a pretty good job at determining probable gender based on first name (<a href="https://github.com/bmuller/sexmachine">SexMachine</a>). It was fun to wrangle data around, but not without conflicts.</p>

<p>Some problems:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I wrote a parser for the most recent conference’s webpage, but that parser can’t be used for previous conferences. The layout for the previous year is different from the current layout, and the year before that is available only as a .pdf. The years prior to that aren’t (immediately and openly) available at all!</p></li>
<li><p>The website was not marked up in a way that made it easy to pull in only the speaker names. I had to throw in a lot of remove-if exceptions because I was basically having to pull in anything that was in a p tag and removing very long strings and very short strings (and a few other things).</p></li>
<li><p>Obviously gender is a larger spectrum than the binary male-female and assessment via name is not an ideal method, but I&rsquo;m just playin&#8217; with data here! I think the results will still hold value, but I always feel a little bit icky when I also have to push things into a gender binary.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I can now take the rough breakdown of the data and just modify as needed. To do more complex problems, though, will involve more than just the parsed names in arrays separated by arrays (see below).</p>

<p>I’m not going to be able to pull out the precise data I want, but it was fun project and I was excited to spend a few hours writing (and thinking) in Ruby again, which I hadn’t really had the opportunity to do in the past month or so (it’s been all Javascript and front-end work around these parts).</p>

<p>Side note: Didn’t someone recently run a quick check on the gender breakdown of published authors in The Moving Image? That data is easier to grab because there’s less of it.</p>

<p>Plans going forward:</p>

<ol>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><em>Why won’t Octopress just upload my images?!?!?!?!?!?!, or how I learned to stop worrying and love the source.</em></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/glitch1.png"></p>

<p>I’ve been using Git for a while and I feel like I have a good grasp on it. I’ve also been using Octopress for a while, integrated into Github pages, and I feel like I have a good grasp on it, too. Rake tasks, right? I’ve WRITTEN rake tasks before! I got this! But for some reason, uploading images for me always seemed like it was a miracle that would work sometimes and not work at other times. Y’know… computer magic.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/glitch2.png"></p>

<p>Sometimes it would just straight up EAT my images and I’d have to remake a screen cap and get angry and keep pounding my head against the code-wall. That’s dumb, though. That’s no way to solve a problem, especially when dealing with logical beasts that perform as instructed. But I wasn’t sure what I was doing wrong. I would just keep moving things around and committing until it seemed to give up and take my images.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/glitch3.png"></p>

<p>It’s just not a good way to live.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/glitch4.png"></p>

<p>Are you having this problem, too? I decided to figure it out.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/glitch5.png"></p>

<p>I was dropping my images in the wrong file! With Octopress, there are a lot of potential places to put images. It’s tempting to put it in public/images folder. It’s also tempting to put it in the _deploy/images folder. Those are bad, though. Those are bad. You want to put it in the SOURCE folder. If you stick images in source/images, they will get picked up when running rake generate / rake deploy. If they go anywhere else, the rake task doesn’t know what to do so it just overwrites them and your images will just disappear.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/glitch6.png"></p>

<p>Maybe this is a no-brainer, but sometimes I feel like a no-brainer, myself.</p>

<h1>P.S.</h1>

<p>Another note! It&rsquo;s important to use the right syntax when adding images. One method in Markdown is to use this syntax:</p>

<p> <code>![netflixforbooks](images/markdown.png)</code></p>

<p>But for Octopress, you want to use this:</p>

<p> <img class="center" src="/images/markdown.png"></p>

<p>Otherwise, images will work on the front page of your blog but they won&rsquo;t work when you visit the individual pages. The more you know&hellip;!</p>

<ul>
<li>I had to use an image tag because otherwise Markdown automatically transforms it into regular html, aka <code>&lt;img class="center" src="/images/markdown.png"&gt;</code> So meta!</li>
</ul>

		<p><img class="center" src="/images/oyster.png"></p>

<p>I came up with an idea to make a spoof/parody of the recently launched <a href="https://www.oysterbooks.com">Oyster</a>, a company that purports to be the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/07/technology/personaltech/aiming-to-be-the-netflix-of-books.html">“Netflix of books,”</a> allowing rentable access to digital books. This hit a sore spot among the librarians I know (and as a former librarian, I know many), because one of the biggest struggles in the field is increasing awareness in the capabilities of the modern library. Most libraries HAVE eBook access, plenty of it, and a lot of materials can be accessed through a library’s website without even having to go into the library. I think a service like Oyster has a lot of value, but I wanted to remind people that they can utilize the free resources available nearby.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/worldcat.png"></p>

<p>So, I basically just made a splash page for WorldCat. WorldCat is a collective catalog used by over 72,000 libraries. Searching a book on WorldCat, a user can add their zip code and find the closest location of that resource, so she could know exactly where to go to pick it up. If I look up Harry Potter and request the eBook format, I can see that its available at several libraries near me, one of which is the Brooklyn Public Library. Assuming the user has a library card, she can just log in and get the book onto her preferred digital book reader in very little time. WorldCat is great, but its underused (just like our local libraries). It&rsquo;s also kinda ugly, so why not make it hip to modern internet eyes?</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/netflixforbooks.png"></p>

<p>I really wanted to integrate the WorldCat API into this project, but unfortunately the API is not open and available to the public. This isn’t the time or place to ramble on about the benefits of open source and open access to databases and applications, but I would have been able to put a lot more time and effort into making a more beautiful and friendlier front-end for the face of public libraries. Alas, alas.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>To follow up my last <a href="http://ablwr.github.io/blog/2014/09/18/breaking-it-down/">blog about blogging</a> (meta), here is the blog post I originally intended to write. I’m pushing it up the queue over the other 13 pending posts.</p>

<p>Flatiron School was hard. It was one of the toughest, enduring challenges I’ve ever done in my life, and also the most rewarding. I got completely comfortable working from 8am to 10pm every day, excited to write code and build stuff and make things happen. After graduation, it can be hard to not lose that momentum.</p>

<p>Before coming to Flatiron, I had a regular 9-5 job as cataloging manager at a film archive. On top of that, I did some freelance consulting work. Well, it was really more like sub-consulting, if that is a thing. Anyway, I worked a lot independently. I have a couple of friends that, for a while, paid for desks at a coworking space here in New York and it was hard for me to understand how someone could justify paying so much money for a desk while freelancing instead of just working from home (and thus having to work less because you don&rsquo;t have to work the extra amount it takes to pay for the coworking space desk). I could understand the social benefits of working around others, but overall I just never understood the &ldquo;going to a coffee shop to work&rdquo; thing. Throughout college, I always worked from my dorm or house and hardly set foot in the library except to grab up books (which is kinda funny, since I have an advanced degree in library and information science now). Back to the point: I started getting paid to work, which means I had to pay attention to what I was doing and work efficiently. With personal projects or homework, it&rsquo;s fine to dabble around. But when it&rsquo;s business, I knew I had to stay focused or I&rsquo;d have to start billing half-hours, which means I&rsquo;d work for 4 hours but only really work for 2, which is a waste of my own time because all 4 hours certainly still felt like I was working, even if half of it was non-billed procrastination time. I also have two cats. They are very cute, but they are also capable of being very annoying.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is how I discovered the joy of having a space dedicated to just working and I renounced all negative vibes I had towards paying $500 for a desk in Brooklyn. Back in South Carolina, I worked for a University on weekdays and spent my weekends working on projects at the University library. I&rsquo;d work from home on weeknights, but it was so much harder to get things done when I kept getting distracted by little things like dirty dishes, crooked books on a shelf, making tea, neighbors, or cats. Mostly the cats.</p>

<p>Getting back to the point&hellip; after Flatiron, we were welcome to continue working on campus, which is great! Fortunately for me and 15 other recently minted lady developers, I was selected to participate in the <a href="http://flatironschool.com/fogcreek">Flatiron / Fog Creek Fellowship</a>.</p>

<p>Here is what we all get, according to the website:</p>

<blockquote><p>What Fellows get:</p>

<p>• A dedicated mentor from both the Fog Creek and Trello teams</p>

<p>• Events with the Fog Creek and Trello staff including Cofounders Joel Spolsky and Michael Pryor</p>

<p>• A desk at Fog Creek</p>

<p>• Daily lunch</p>

<p>• Technical interview practice and guidance</p>

<p>• Four 1:1 pairing sessions</p>

<p>• Help choosing and feedback on a side project</p>

<p>• 1:1 lunch with your mentor every other week</p></blockquote>

<p>To summarize: A desk, a lunch, a dude telling you stuff. To be honest, I wasn&rsquo;t sure how this was going to go down at first. To be even more honest, I was a little sad to be separated from my Flatiron classmates that would still be working at the home base. But the baby bird has to leave the nest sometime&hellip; I was kinda excited about the desk, though. Because I knew being out of the Flatiron work-all-the-time mode was going to be hard, and not having a dedicated space to work was going to be even harder. Looking for a job is hard and I am just as busy now as I was when I was still in the program.</p>

<p>I missed the fellowship orientation because I was driving from South Carolina to New York with two desks to not-work-at-home-at and two cats, among other things, so I was a little nervous to just pop right into such a highly regarded software company.</p>

<p>Immediately, though, I was made to feel SO WELCOME. My mentor is SUPER RAD, he sent me a bunch of emails in advance, he read through my blog and had a lot of questions to ask me. He is always ready to sit down with me at any time to teach me some of the more theory-heavy aspects of computer programming that I mostly missed out on, to ask me about how my job search is going, or to just make me watch the first ten minutes of Up and explain how it relates to software engineering AND LIFE. Everyone at Fog Creek / Trello has been SOOOO extremely nice and welcoming, and I am so happy to be participating in the inaugural fellowship. The mentors all got together and came up with a dedicated time (and trello board) to helping all of us collectively train up on Computer Science fundamentals.</p>

<p>It truly feels like a fellowship, by the academic definition. We all get access to resources like desks and lunch and an unlimited snack bar (oh god, the snack bar, the snack bar&hellip;) and open access to a very nice espresso machine, but more importantly we get things like Joel Spolsky personally teaching us how to use the espresso machine (something that I think many established software engineers have dreamt about at night), casual lunch conversations about time travel (this comes up a lot), talent shows, board game nights, and Friday socials.</p>

<p>So&hellip; what&rsquo;s the lesson from this blog post? Desks are important for working hard, but more important than a desk and a space is the people that you surround yourself with when working, so I&rsquo;m thrilled to get to regularly hang with such a great team of people while I work on finding a place to work. Thank you so much, Flatiron and Fog Creek &amp; Trello!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>When I started at the Flatiron School in June, I told myself I was going to blog about my feelings and what I was learning every week. EVERY week. Then, when I graduated and inevitably had not written a single blog post about how it was going, I said I was gonna write a big ol’ jumbo blog post about the whole twelve weeks and everything I learned and how amazing it was.</p>

<p>Anyway, I graduated a month ago and there is still no e-novella.</p>

<p>This covers two important lessons in programming:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Don’t get into code debt.</strong> If I had worked a little bit at a time towards my goal, I would have a weekly summary of what I was learning and doing while at Flatiron. But to speak to the other side of code debt: not writing about my experience was a bummer, but I was definitely spending it learning how to be a better programmer, which was the higher priority at the time, so I don’t feel too bad about it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Break problems down into smaller problems.</strong> Since I wasn’t a diligent blogger, I wanted to just write one big post about Flatiron. But that’s such a large task! There’s SO much I want to cover, so where would I even begin? The most important advice I have to regularly give myself is to break problems down into smaller problems, otherwise I potentially get overwhelmed and not know where to start, which would result in just never starting.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Anyway, I hope to get those blog posts out in the world soon. If you are reading this because you are doing some cyber-research on the Flatiron School and are thinking of applying, do not hesitate for one second to get in touch! I love talking about it. I just haven&rsquo;t had the time to sit down and really blog it out.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Basically, I have a history of taking jokes too far. See also: <a href="http://instagram.com/p/ruP0rHjtbO/?modal=true">Tattoos of Avi’s face</a>. So when I was exploring <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>’s <a href="http://popcornjs.org">Popcorn.js</a> and missing my Flatiron peers, I coded up a small app that would help me learn how to use Popcorn.js aaaaaaaand also troll my friends.</p>

<p>At Flatiron, we used a shared playlist system called <a href="http://sonos.com">Sonos</a>. Everyone could add tracks from online music collections like Spotify, Hype Machine, or Songza. Near the last third of the semester, as we were all on the brink of insanity and exhaustion, one song in particular kept making a rude appearance. I don’t know who started it or why, but the entire Flatiron office had to suffer through many, many, many instances of Seal’s Kiss from a Rose.</p>

<p>After Flatiron graduation, I was pretty excited to dig into some new projects while on the job hunt, but really missed hanging out with all of my Flatiron buds. To alleviate my withdrawl symptoms, I decided to integrate my Popcorn.js learning into an app to basically troll everyone I know.</p>

<p>To troll successfully, though, I first had to troll myself. Because music videos on youtube don&rsquo;t come with subtitles, I had to make those subtitles happen manually. I once had a job transcribing interviews, so I&rsquo;m pretty fast. But to get the timing right, I still had to submit myself to many, many listens of the same song.</p>

<p>Popcorn.js makes it easy to add supplemental media to video files based on timing.</p>

<p>Within a document listener, you create an instance variable with the .youtube suffix (obviously it&rsquo;s different if you are not using the YouTube API to access a video, but for this example, I used YouTube) and then declare a landing div ID and a link to the video itself.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'>   <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">pop</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">Popcorn</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">youtube</span><span class="p">(</span>
</span><span class='line'>     <span class="s1">&#39;#video&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>     <span class="s1">&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4tTnIimi8E&#39;</span> <span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Afterwards, it&rsquo;s time to start adding footnotes! This takes in four options &mdash; a start time (in seconds), an end time (also in seconds, big surprise), the text you want to display, and the target div. The application of subtitle footnotes is simple, but it&rsquo;s easy to see what kind of complex and interesting things can be done based on video playback times.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'>   <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">footnote</span><span class="p">({</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nx">start</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">94</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nx">end</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">97</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nx">text</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Won&#39;t you tell me is that healthy, baby?&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nx">target</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;footnotediv&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="p">})</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p> At the end, just trigger play.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">pop</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">play</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Try it yourself! <a href="http://ablwr.github.io/flatiron-karaoke">Sing your heart out here</a>.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also an easter egg, but you have to patiently wait for it (or sing sing sing for it).</p>

<p>User feedback: It worked! Everyone typed in a song and got Seal back and tried it again because they thought it was a bug. NOPE. The only person that didn’t get trolled had preemptively trolled by searching for “Kiss from a Rose” so she didn’t know it was the only possible song that could be returned.</p>

<p>In the future, I’d like to spend more time trying to figure out how a real karaoke app could be created by automatically generating accurate subtitles. I’d also like to spend more time on the CSS styles so I could figure out how to fake the text highlighting on karaoke videos. As I mentioned earlier, there&rsquo;s an easter egg &mdash; I&rsquo;d like to work on incorporating more complex supplemental data alongside video files, such as Google maps, Wikipedia page load triggers, and images.</p>

		<p><a href="https://github.com/antiboredom/videogrep">Videogrep</a> is a Python-based application that searches through a video file using its subtitles track and can cut video clips based on its search criteria.</p>

<p>Videogrep is SUPER easy to use&hellip; as long as ffmpeg is installed properly. If not, prepare for some configuring and installing.</p>

<p>I used videogrep to search through one of my favorite movies, Terrorvision, to find every time a character refers to something as &ldquo;The Pleasure (noun).&rdquo; Hint: it happens more times than you would think.</p>

<p>To do this, I only had to type one line and videogrep did the rest of the work.</p>

<p><code>python videogrep.py -i Terrorvision/Terrorvision.avi -o test_video.mp4 --search 'Pleasure'</code></p>

<p>It searched through the subtitles file and found six instances, which it printed to the screen along with their timestamps.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>If there is an error, at this point it will let you know. But if all goes well, the following will print to the screen:</p>

<p><code>Your video is ready ! Fingers crossed for the Oscars !</code></p>

<p>Here is the video supercut. Something that might have taken a few hours for me to piece together using my memory of the movie and video editing software was done in less than a minute using the powers of Python and FFMpeg.</p>

<p>Voila!</p>

<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/99057389" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/99057389">Pleasure Supercut</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/orangelazarus">Ashley Blewer</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p></p>

<p>This was just a simple example, but videogrep can get more specific based on the regular expression added into the search string. In the above example, I knew &ldquo;Pleasure&rdquo; was a proper noun because its the name of many rooms in the Putterman household. If I really wanted to grab every instance of the word, I would have had to search for &lsquo;pleasure|Pleasure&rsquo; to capture both uppercase and lowercase.</p>

<p>Videogrep can be even more powerful because it understands <a href="http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pages/pattern-search">pattern recognition using pattern search</a>. I was able to extract what I wanted by just typing in one word, but it also understands word patterns. For example, you can use flags like JJ for adjective or NN for noun and it will extract every instance of a particular speech pattern.</p>

<p>It can also search for hypernyms, which are words that fit into a certain category and have a semantic relation to each other. For example, if you searched for automobile, you might also want to extract similar words like car, truck, or van. If you weren&rsquo;t picky about what kind of bird you were looking for, a hypernym search would result in crows, seagulls, and eagles.</p>

<p>Enjoy using videogrep and watch out for the monster!</p>
